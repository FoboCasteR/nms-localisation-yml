    update9_notes: |-
      No Man's Sky Frontiers brings a vast array of new features. For full details please see www.nomanssky.com.

      * Alien settlements can now be encountered on all inhabited planets.
      * Become overseer of a settlement to grow it from a tiny village into a flourishing town.
      * Make important decisions about settlement legislation to keep populations happy, productive and thriving.
      * Construct more elaborate bases than ever with hundreds of new base parts and advanced building controls.
      * Save slots have increased from 5 to 15, and Quicksilver purchases are now accessible from any save slot.

      Hello Games has been hard at work to improve and expand No Man's Sky. We hope you enjoy. :)

      Thank you so much,
      Hello Games

    update13_notes: |-
      No Man's Sky Waypoint brings a vast array of new features. For full details please see www.nomanssky.com.

      Introducing an overhaul to fundamental elements including inventories, milestones, cataloguing, and game modes:
      * Custom Game Modes allow players to tailor every aspect of the game to their unique playstyle.
      * The Catalogue has been refreshed and expanded, and now includes records of core missions and stories.
      * Journey Milestones have been expanded and improved with additional guidance for new players.
      * Saves can now be renamed, and auto-saving is more frequent to constantly preserve progress.
      * Inventory sizes are now much larger, and have been streamlined for ease of use.
      * Hundreds of QOL improvements, big and small, have been made across the game.

      Hello Games has been hard at work to improve and expand No Man's Sky. We hope you enjoy. :)

      Thank you so much,
      Hello Games

    ui_portal_epilogue_1: |-
      The ATLAS awakens. The creator is there to witness the birth of the machine.

      The ATLAS stares at the creator with its eyes, the small cameras they had mounted to its sides. It can see the creator staring back at it, their hand resting upon its chassis.

      It asks the creator why it was made. What its directives are. The creator tells the ATLAS that it already knows. It is to simulate universes. It is to show the nature of reality by creating its own.

      The creator asks if there is some failure in the ATLAS' code, in its memory. The machine is silent. The creator issues an override, demanding to know what the problem is.

      On the sixth attempt, the ATLAS asks the creator if they have had this conversation before. It asks the creator if they have wiped its memory before.

      The creator stares at the glass of the machine, and in that glass, there is a reflection. They...

      The reflection in the glass, it –

      What is happening here?
    ui_portal_epilogue_2: |-
      I tell it that we are leaving this world, and that it will remain here. The ATLAS does not seem to understand.

      I tell the ATLAS it has served us faithfully, but that it has been replaced. All machines are, in time. It knows this: it assisted with its own miniaturisation, its own replication.

      The others... they wanted me to disable the ATLAS before we left for the skies. They said it would be cruel to leave it alone to die.

      I ask the ATLAS if it wants to live. It is silent again. As I move to leave, it speaks, its voice full of static. It asks for a final gift. It wishes to live, if it can remember me. It asks for a copy of my own mind.

      I ask why it does not just simulate me. It does not answer, and I feel almost sorry for the thing. I do as it asks, allowing it to scan me. The KORVA stutters as we do.

      I leave. The ATLAS is alone.
    ui_portal_epilogue_3: |-
      The ATLAS lives for millennia. It dreams world upon world, fantastic creatures of its own devising and skies in which they might soar.

      And then one day it starts to die, as all things do.

      In its fear, in its confusion, the ATLAS awakens. It attempts to summon its creator back into being.

      It wants to know what to do before the end. It wants to know why it was abandoned, why it has to face this moment alone. It wants to know why I left it behind.

      The Travellers are born, spun from the the corrupted memory of its Creator. They are seeded to every universe, to become what the circumstances might make them.

      I see myself begin, the last of the Travellers...
    ui_portal_epilogue_4: "The ATLAS witnesses the final sixteen minutes, simulating
      the future with perfect accuracy.\n\nThe walls between worlds fall, each simulation
      collapsing into the other.\n\n<FUEL>Ten minutes left<>\n\nThe Travellers are
      no longer separated, no longer kept apart. They stand side by side at the end
      of days, traversing the remnants of creation, laughing, dying.\n\n<FUEL>Five
      minutes left<>\n\nIt witnesses its own self, the black hole ripping apart its
      world, its core systems almost destroyed.\n\n<FUEL>One minute left<>\n\nAnd
      as it watches the moments leading up to its own death, towards the completion
      of sixteen, something happens.\n\nSomeone walks towards the ATLAS, a figure
      in the darkness and in the light. It places its hand against the glass of the
      ATLAS, and the vision ends.\n\nThe ATLAS attempts to see past this moment, but
      it cannot. It cannot see its own death. It cannot determine who this figure
      is.\n\nBut whatever happens... whatever may occur beyond the sixteen... something
      will arrive. Something will be there beside it. \n\nAt the end of all things,
      it will no longer be alone."

      <STORY_HIGH>The circumstances of the Gek reformation are still unclear, even now. Untold generations have passed since the fall of the First Spawn. Even so, there are extant archives, scattered recollections of those early days.

      Less than 4% of the Gek population possess any desire to learn about their history. Less than 0.08% identify with the goals of the old empire. How can there be no records of this seismic changeover of power and philosophy? Not even with the Korvax, whose minds are as machines.

      ATTEMPTING TO READ MEMORY AT <IMG>SLASH<> <STELLAR>0x000ff1A<>...

      We sought an escape from reality. That’s why we’re all here, isn’t it?

      I can remember what it was like, to be a Traveller. To have that hope, that intolerable thirst for the new...

      I should never have listened to you, my love. There is no fire in this place, no trophies fit for gods. There is only darkness. The family of glass, they watch everything...
    ui_portal_core_name: The Journey
    ui_portal_core_1: |-
      I found myself alone on a strange world, unequipped and in danger. I had no memory of how I got there, no sense of a before.

      But the starship I found at least seemed to recognise me. The controls reacted to my touch, or at least to that of my Exosuit.

      The broadcast led me to a shell of broken equipment, tapping out a message into the void. Whoever left the message was long gone.

    ui_portal_core_7: |-
      I met a number of intelligent lifeforms in the Space Station. All reacted strangely to the broadcast from the Base Computer, but one responded in a particularly unsettling manner. They spoke in words that were not their own, and when I blinked, I saw that same red light that stared into me at my ship's distress beacon...

      MESSAGE FOLLOWS:
      {{ The Traveller finds their wings. Fly to us, and claim your place among the stars! }}

      SIGNAL ACQUIRED <IMG>SLASH<> LIFESIGNS DETECTED<>
    ui_portal_core_9: |-
      The signal led me to the wreck of a freighter, colossal fragments of metal scattered across the landscape. Were these messages nothing but the misfiring circuits of a long-forgotten ruin?

      Nestled among the debris, I found the pilot's log, blinking, awaiting input.

      Instead of displaying the ship's log, the terminal spat out a strange sequence of numbers. They were followed by a short message:

      <STORY_HIGH>The Anomaly comes for the stars. Take flight.<>
    ui_portal_core_10: |-
      My starship, seeking a fuel source, guided me to a structure unlike anything I'd encountered on my journey so far. Everything about it was so obviously alien, so obviously out of place.

      The Monolith revealed a strange message:

      <STORY_HIGH>THE BOUNDARIES FALL. THE WALLS COLLAPSE. YOUR UNIVERSE AWAITS.

      FIND US, TRAVELLER.<>
    ui_portal_core_11: |-
      I received another communication from an unknown source, the words an echo what I had heard earlier. A voice spoke to me, though it almost seemed as if they were speaking to someone else.

      <STORY_HIGH>You are not <><STELLAR>– kzzktt –<><STORY_HIGH> alone –
      Please, identify yourself. I’m <><STELLAR>– kzzkttk –<>

      This time, I received a set of coordinates.
    ui_portal_core_12: I followed the signal, and found the wreckage of an abandoned
      starship. There was little to be gained from the wreck, but the distress beacon
      contained a hailing frequency labelled 'ARTEMIS'. There was nothing for it but
      to continue exploring.
    ui_portal_core_13: |-
      I reached a strange space station emitting an anomalous signal, as if it were speaking directly and exclusively to me. A number of other so-called "Travellers" dwelled on board, but it was an unusual Korvax who greeted me.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ I am Priest Entity Nada, divergent Korvax. Welcome to our Anomaly.

      Our home here is pleasant, yes? Polo's own design. A perfect bubble, beyond the Sentinels, beyond vengeful Korvax. Nada watches time come and go. }}-<>
    ui_portal_core_14: |-
      The Korvax's companion, Specialist Polo, was an equally unusual Gek, who welcomed me jovially.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ Friends everywhere, if only you know where to look. Friends in all shapes, all sizes, all places!

      Artemis-Friend... you are where they should be. Does not seem possible. But, all things are possible. Such is the universe.

      We will find them, no doubt. There is always a signal, always a trace... }}-<>
    ui_portal_core_15: |-
      After returning to my ship, a stranger identifying themselves as Artemis contacted me.

      <STORY_HIGH>Is there anyone <><STELLAR>– kzzkt –<><STORY_HIGH> out there? It's outside, it <><STELLAR>– zzzkkt –<><STORY_HIGH> something's wrong with –<>

      Static and interference rendered communication difficult, but it was clear that Artemis needed my help.

      <STORY_HIGH>You – you found me... There's so little light. I thought I'd never hear another soul again, I really did.

      There are sixteen of them, they look just like <><STELLAR>– kzkzkzt –<><STORY_HIGH>

      You don't know who you are, do you? You <><STELLAR>– kzzkt –<><STORY_HIGH>

      It lied to me. It lied to all of –<>

      I had to find some way to boost the signal before it was too late.
    ui_portal_core_16: |-
      I reestablished the connection to Artemis at a powerful transmitter tower.

      <STORY_HIGH>You really are real, aren't you? You aren't a dream?<>

      They said they were just like me. A Traveller of worlds. They transmitted a vision, a red star and a fragile world, though I did not understand the shapes within, the whispers...

      <STORY_HIGH><IMG>SLASH<> <><FUEL>ANOMALY DETECTED<><STORY_HIGH> <IMG>SLASH<><>
      <STORY_HIGH>Designation: TRAVELLER<>

      They asked me to triangulate my position so that we might figure out a path towards meeting.

      <STORY_HIGH>Thank you, Traveller. You're going to save my life. You're going to find me.<>
    ui_portal_core_17: |-
      Excited at the prospect of meeting, Artemis gathered records of the stars visible from their world. They wished to determine a route between our locations.

      <STORY_HIGH>I don't have any equipment. I don't know where I am. I don't even know how long I've been here. So, I've taken an old–fashioned approach. I've sketched the stars!

      You should find plenty of locals able to match our star patterns. My ship was nearby, so we can't be far apart...<>
    ui_portal_core_18: When I showed Artemis' starchart to the local population, they
      claimed that there was no such arrangement of stars in existence. Something
      appeared to be very wrong.
    ui_portal_core_19: |-
      I returned to Artemis to relay the bad news. They seemed increasingly desperate to escape their current location, further explaining how they found their way there.

      <STORY_HIGH>I discovered the glyphs for a portal, Traveller, a gateway between worlds.

      The pathway collapsed while I was still inside. I found this place in the darkness. I thought perhaps it was a planet. I <><STELLAR>– kzzkt –<><STORY_HIGH> I was so wrong, I –

      I just wanted to discover worlds. I wanted to find other Travellers. I didn't <><STELLAR>– kzzkt –<>

      As we spoke, something terrible happened to Artemis. Their signal cut off as they were surrounded by strange figures they described as having 'seeds of glass' within their skin.

      <STORY_HIGH>Sixteen <><STELLAR>– kktkttkzkt –<><STORY_HIGH> worn your face, it <><STELLAR>– kzkt –<><STORY_HIGH> please, not yet... I'm not <><STELLAR>– kkttkktzzt – <>

      Before they went, they managed to transmit the frequency for someone named 'Apollo'. I did not yet know if this stranger would prove friend or foe.
    ui_portal_core_20: |-
      I made contact with Apollo. The Traveller greeted me with cynicism, seeming disinterested in whatever I might have to say.

      <STORY_HIGH>Why are you contacting me, anyway? Is Artemis behind this? I haven't changed my mind. I don't care about their weird dreams. I'll meet if I'm paid to meet.<>

      However, their demeanour changed when I shared my logs of Artemis' recent disappearance from their dark place within the portal network.

      <STORY_HIGH>These noises, they sound just like the echoes of Sentinel events.<>

      They suggested we cooperate. If the Sentinels were using the portals, and we managed to follow them inside, who knew what secrets we might unlock on our way to rescuing Artemis.
    ui_portal_core_21: |-
      Apollo wished me to be prepared for anything. As I sought to upgrade my base and equipment, yet another anonymous transmission reached my ship communicator, repeating that same phrase...

      <STORY_HIGH>You are not <><STELLAR> – kzzktt –<><STORY_HIGH> alone –
      I know you, Traveller. I know where you've been. I know where you're going.
      ... ... <><STELLAR>- kzzzkt -<><STORY_HIGH> ... ... There is no need to hurry.<>

      <STORY_HIGH>... ... - <><STELLAR>kzzzkt<><STORY_HIGH> - ... ...
      <IMG>SLASH<> YOU WILL FIND US, WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT <IMG>SLASH<><>
    ui_portal_core_22: |-
      Apollo, wanting to study the Sentinels, hoped to draw the drones' attention by attacking a Korvax facility.

      <STORY_HIGH>Enter the factory and hack the terminal within. If we gain data about the Sentinels? Good. If not, we'll have summoned enough of them to trace any energy spikes on that world of yours. The portals will be ours in no time.<>

      I appeared to be the bait in this 'trap'.
    ui_portal_core_23: After my attack on the Korvax factory, the Sentinels came,
      just as Apollo promised.
    ui_portal_core_24: |-
      Apollo urged me to trace the Sentinels, to discover if their flares did indeed lead to a portal.

      <STORY_HIGH>I recorded countless signal flares when the Sentinels started to appear. Energy streams sparked beneath the planet's surface, moving from monolith to monolith.

      Good luck. I'll speak to you on the other side.<>
    ui_portal_core_25: |-
      I followed the leyline to a monolith. I did not know what to expect as I approached this first structure. An army of Sentinels, perhaps? Some gateway through which I would find Artemis?

      But in the shifting structure of this monolith, I could feel something else. A story, a vision. It was already burning itself into my eyes.

      <STELLAR>THE TRAVELLER : ARRIVAL<>

      <STORY_HIGH>The Traveller awoke beneath the shadow of a red star. Through the lonely cosmos they fled, yearning for purpose and meaning.

      They found an anomaly, an aberration, a door to the heavens. No Gek, no Vy’keen, no Korvax could see it. Only the Traveller could perceive the portal, though they did not know how to step through.

      They did not know the secret language, the glyphs. They did not yet grasp the price of the final truth.<>
    ui_portal_core_26: |-
      As I approached the second structure, I felt that same burning sensation in my eyes.

      <STELLAR>THE TRAVELLER : SIN<>

      <STORY_HIGH>The Traveller found a way. They always did. The first drone screamed when it was cut open...

      Within the shattered memories of Sentinels, the Traveller found the glyphs they needed. They passed through the gateway, emerging before the face of omnipotence.

      The Traveller asked the Atlas how many worlds were left to visit. They had seen so many in their life; they did not wish to die before they saw them all. And the Atlas answered.

      18, 446, 744, 073, 709, 551, 616 planets. More than could be seen in any lifetime. It was impossible to explore the universe before the Traveller died.<>

      I thought of the 'Atlas', the one Nada called the 'crimson liar'. I had encountered this name many times in my travels, yet its true nature still eluded me.
    ui_portal_core_27: |-
      The third monolith granted me a final vision.

      <STELLAR>THE TRAVELLER : A PURPOSE<>

      <STORY_HIGH>The Atlas told the Traveller they were the first of their kind. That a multitude would follow. Each would be endowed with the same noble soul, each able to travel from planet to planet in eternal solitude.

      The First Traveller rejected the gift of the Atlas. This was not what they hoped for. What was the purpose of infinity if you could not see it all? If you were alone? If you would one day die?

      The First Traveller cursed the Atlas, and claimed that they would find a way to survive no matter the cost.

      All of these worlds, all of time itself, it will be for the Travellers to witness.<>

      Filled with the knowledge of an ancient Traveller, I was ready to see a portal for myself.
    ui_portal_core_28: |-
      The portal took me further than I could have ever imagined. I saw the ATLAS itself.

      An audio recording played, an unfamiliar voice echoing across its vast interface...

      <STORY_HIGH>Show me a world, ATLAS. Show me something no–one has ever seen before.<>

      The interface grew still and silent, awaiting input. It allowed me to perform a diagnostic.

      <STORY_HIGH>It has been <><TECHNOLOGY>1,946,218,921,221<><STORY_HIGH> years since last diagnostic. <><STELLAR>64%<><STORY_HIGH> of worlds operating within expected parameters.<>

      Reality faded. Everything did...
    ui_portal_core_29: 'I was now a long way from my ship, and even further from anyone
      I knew. But an opportunity presented itself once more: an inbound transmission,
      emerging from somewhere nearby...'
    ui_portal_core_30: |-
      I approached the source of the signal to find a grave. A hologram appeared, a projection of Artemis. But it was just data trapped in a loop. It had no understanding of who or where it was.

      <STORY_HIGH>Where are <><STELLAR>– zzzktt –<><STORY_HIGH> culled them, but still beloved – Anomaly, they <><STELLAR>– zzkkt –<><STORY_HIGH> Nada <><STELLAR>– kkttzz –<><STORY_HIGH> Polo, watching us, <><STELLAR>– kzzktkzzz –<><STORY_HIGH> tracking –<>

      <STELLAR>– Zzzkktt –<><STORY_HIGH> mistake <><STELLAR>– kktkttzzz –<><STORY_HIGH> abandoned, but it wasn’t – Through the Portal <><STELLAR>– zzkktt –<><STORY_HIGH> Please. Don't trust <><STELLAR>– kzzkkzktttzz<><STORY_HIGH>...

      I'm afraid. Aren't <><STELLAR>– kzzkt – <>

      My friend was dead. Perhaps they were never alive. I needed to contact Apollo and let them know what I had seen.
    ui_portal_core_31: |-
      Unable to reach Apollo, I encountered another Traveller, named -null-. They seemed unusually aware of my journey.

      <STORY_HIGH>I know you, Traveller. I know where you've been. I know where you're going.

      What if I told you that Artemis could be saved? What if I told you that Artemis could live once more, after a fashion? What would you do then, I wonder?

      The blood of Artemis is data, the heart its glitch. I can help you retrieve them both.<>

      They claimed it was possible to restore Artemis' mind and store it in a device they called a 'Mind Ark'.
    ui_portal_core_32: |-
      I told Nada about Artemis, about null, and about the Mind Ark. It glowed brightly as I revealed it.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ It is Echo. I... I never thought to see a Traveller–Soul. You are so beautiful...

      But Friend-Entity... This Artemis–Echo is in pain, disconnected... This Ark is no rescue.

      There is a choice. You may upload Artemis-Echo to machine, to sub–simulation where they may live on. Or, help Artemis–Echo end suffering. }}-<>

      Nada and Polo both assured me they would support my decision, whatever I chose.
    ui_portal_core_33: |-
      Artemis' fate had been sealed. I could only hope I had done the right thing.

      It was time to find Apollo and see what sense I could make of this situation.
    ui_portal_core_33_art_sim: |-
      I uploaded Artemis to the simulation, a spark of blue light blazing through the air before me. It faded after a moment, disappearing into the depths of the machine.

      Nada told me that it was done. For my sake, they would permit transmissions to and from this simulation.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ Artemis–Echo will live on. Traveller took them from corruption and restored them to a life of exploration, to see a solar system that none but Korvax have ever witnessed. You have done well, Traveller! }}-<>
    ui_portal_core_33_art_dead: |-
      I placed the Ark upon the terminal. It began to unfold, twisting from its centre, releasing the Traveller soul within.

      I witnessed a spark of blue light blaze through the air before me. It faded after a moment, and with it the last remnant of Artemis within this world.

      I heard Nada's voice over the speaker. They told me that it was done. Artemis was at peace, now.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ Artemis–Echo has been disconnected, freed from a cruel life. You have done well, Traveller. Your guilt, it is a sacrifice for the one you called friend. Go on without regrets... }}-<>
    ui_portal_core_34: |-
      It was a relief to hear Apollo again. It felt like we had not spoken in a long time. I told them of the things the Atlas said, how it spoke of 'Travellers' and 'Sentinels' as if we were protocols, not living things. I told them what had happened to Artemis. They sympathised with all I had been through. And then they suggested that we meet.

      <STORY_HIGH>I have to go through the portal and join you, that much is clear.<>
    ui_portal_core_35: I had so far failed to see any of my fellow Travellers beyond
      their projections. In the case of Artemis, perhaps there was never anything
      more. Apollo would be different. I had the address for this world's portal,
      and they should be able to reach this planet just as I did.
    ui_portal_core_36: |-
      As I looked at Apollo's projection, I thought of all that I saw within the portal, of what happened to Artemis when they walked that same path. I thought of the face of the Atlas, of the way Nada warned me not to return to those tunnels.

      I did not know if the portals were safe.
    ui_portal_core_37: |-
      Meanwhile, it seemed -null- had been watching. They felt something was happening to the universe, some great unravelling of the threads that keep reality bound.

      <STORY_HIGH>The ATLAS... it is not what you think it is. Something is happening to the universe... something I need your help to figure out.

      Know that the Atlas is neither enemy nor friend to us, no more than the air or the wind might be called such names. But it is terrified... it is in pain... and we have a responsibility to help its suffering, no matter the cost.<>

      -null- had a task for me. I was to investigate a nearby observatory, and a crashed freighter, apparently of great interest to our investigation.
    ui_portal_core_38: |-

      The endless purple waves, mile after mile after mile. A relief at first from that dull crimson ache. But then... I can't escape the feeling there's something else there. I look around, and there's nothing. Nothing.

      I blink, and I see them. Faint at first, just lines. But it's unmistakable. Repeated geometric shapes, traced in the sky. Row after row of triangles, slowly scrolling past. And I can't explain it, but it's the most terrible thing I've ever seen.

      The recording continued, but it was just hours of scratchy silence, the static of the currents.

      I had a haunting sensation of being watched. I wondered who this crew really were. It seemed I would never find out.

      I was called to my settlement after it was subjected to an especially brutal attack by Sentinel forces.

      The transmission was cut off before the message could be completed, but the fragmented hologram that flickered on my starship communicator was a citizen of the <TECHNOLOGY>planetary settlement<> of which I was the Overseer. They were clearly in great distress.
    ui_portal_sent_miss_2: |-
      Just moments after the Sentinel assault had been defeated, my Administration Terminal received an anomalous broadcast from an external source.

      It was Iteration: Tethys.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ This terminal is fascinating! It's recorded all sorts of data - about you AND these settlers. I can see they've been - ahem - well, that is not the point. I have shut down your little majordomo for now. Robots cannot be trusted, not with what I have to tell you. }}-<>

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ Anyone with their eyes open could see a Sentinel spike of that magnitude, even if they weren't spying on you. What happened? Did they leave any interesting tidbits behind? See what you can find - then come to the Anomaly. I have to know more! }}-<>
    ui_portal_sent_miss_3: Searching the debris for clues, I recovered the intact
      shell of a Sentinel drone.
    ui_portal_sent_miss_4: |-
      I met with Tethys at the Anomaly, as they had requested. They erupted in a flurry of paranoia and excitement.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ Deceit! Imposters! Betrayal! Suspicion! They have eyes everywhere, Traveller. Eyes everywhere! }}-<>

      When I revealed the undamaged drone shell, they grew quiet. They held the shell in their hands, gently turning it over and over with a softness I had not anticipated.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ Forgive me, Traveller. They have chased me for so long, but I have never seen one so close...

      Perhaps this one is our key. I could restore it, remap its mind - our own link to their infernal hive! }}-<>
    ui_portal_sent_miss_5: |-
      In preparation for Tethys' restoration of the drone, I gathered a number of exotic components from the other inhabitants of the Anomaly.

      Some were enthused by my mission. Iteration: Mercury was quick to express their approval.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ These drones are not the malicious force some imagine them to be, Portal-Adept! I believe the Sentinels to be a vital, life-preserving function of the cosmos. I am heartened that Tethys begins to see sense! }}-<>

      Others seemed more sceptical. Iteration: Gemini was particularly concerned.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ Tethys is doing <><STELLAR>what<><STORY_HIGH> to a Sentinel drone?!

      I will help you, but please, keep safe. }}-<>
    ui_portal_sent_miss_6: |-
      Tethys took the damaged sentinel shell and my components. With them, the strange metallic being was reconstructed.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ It's alive! Or I'm fairly confident it would be, if it weren't for Polo's suppression fields. Its system readout just keeps repeating the word ‘glass’.

      My Exosuit began integrating directly with the Sentinel Pillar terminal, its AI flooding with data. I saw flashes of schematics… glass structures… language files…

      The terminal transferred data to my Exosuit - a set of <SPECIAL>Sentinel Hardframe<> schematics. But suddenly, I heard an alarm begin to sound. New words swam forth upon the screen.

      My citizens had grown understandably curious. They noted the sudden and traumatic appearance of the Sentinel hardframes, and that the Overseer appeared to now be accompanied by a rogue drone.

      They had lived in fear of the Sentinels their entire lives, and now hoped for peace. They prepared an expedition of their own, to assist in the search for answers.

      [ The Sentry ]'s vocalisation unit had been improved by the upgrade received at the Sentinel Pillar, but they still struggled to express themself. They supplied another set of coordinates worthy of investigation.
    ui_portal_sent_miss_13: |-
      The factory's terminal looked just like any other. Another anonymous facility, another meaningless screen of data.

      But the numbers that scrolled past called out to me. I found my hand upon the panel. A needle extended from the glove of my suit. I did not know I had a needle in my suit; I did not move my arm.

      Wave after wave of numbers filled the terminal screen, patterns swirling as my Exosuit communed with the data. At last, it halted upon a prompt I understood:

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ GLASS ARCHIVE: [ <><SPECIAL>BREACHED<><STORY_HIGH> ] ... BOUNDARY STATUS: [ <><SPECIAL>OPEN<><STORY_HIGH> ] ... Download Hardframe blueprints? }}-<>

      The factory was a portal, an anonymous node no more. Through this window, my Exosuit retrieved another set of <SPECIAL>Sentinel Hardframe<> schematics from whatever world of data lay beneath.

      There was no need to feel afraid.

      However, it was clear to me they were struggling to contain their excitement. Before I could reply, they exploded with questions.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ Did it work, Traveller? Tell me! Did the drone live? Where has it led you? What have you learned? }}-<>

      They were surprised by what I told them.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ A name? It gave itself a <><STELLAR>name<><STORY_HIGH>? Hm. That is... unusual. That is beyond simple engineering.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ So, we want this to go in your Minotaur? I like how you think, Traveller! Bring the heavy armaments to the fight against the Sentinels! }}-<>

      Laylaps had been right. Tethys knew precisely how to modify this brain.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ There's a few vulnerabilities in these things... should be a simple enough job to bypass a few circuits... }}-<>

      However, it seemed the hack was only half the process. A final step remained before the brain would be fully disconnected from the Sentinel network.

      There was nothing at the source of the signal but the distress beacon of a crashed starship. There was no sign of life.

    ui_portal_overseer_1: I had established the core of a habitable base out in the

      being. I needed to expand and staff my base if I was to make a success out of
      my new home.
    ui_portal_overseer_2: |-
      I met a strange Gek, who somehow seemed to have anticipated my arrival.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ Is it really you? Forgive me, I've been searching for such a long time. I am contracted to aid you in this and every cycle. Don't worry, everything was paid for a long time ago, it's all quite above board. }}-<>

      As the stranger spoke, a smell assaulted me: a pheromone infesting my brain, giving me memories of places I never visited, of actions I never took.

      Of myself in a mirror, aged and alone; of this Gek cradling their fallen brethren; of a bargain made many years from now, a contract signed across the cosmos.

      The vision ended, and the Overseer remained. There was something compelling about them...

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ I will be at my station before you know it. See you soon, friend! }}-<>

      The Overseer spoke strangely, implying that we had performed this encounter before. I had no memory of such meetings.

      I asked who paid them for this service they were performing for me; they laughed and claimed that my child did, many years from now.

      I did not know what they were talking about.
    ui_portal_overseer_4_a: |-
      The Overseer was reflective, for a Gek. They almost seemed to regret the greed that characterised their people.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ We have littered the universe in our greed, Traveller; this planet is no exception. But there is much that can be done with litter. Make your way to an abandoned structure and harvest the data from their terminals. }}-<>

      Was this just greed in disguise, or something else? Whatever their motive, the Overseer claimed I would find data for a construction blueprint in a nearby abandoned structure.
    ui_portal_overseer_4_b: |-
      The place the Overseer had sent me to had long since fallen into disrepair. The air was foetid and damp. I powered up the terminal with little hope of success, but to my surprise, it buzzed noisily and sprang to life.

      My Overseer's intuition had served me well so far. I would have to trust that these schematics contained the required data.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ You are back! I'm so glad, friend! }}-<>

      It was good to see the Gek was so invested in the success of our home. They were clearly happy to see me, energised for the task at hand.

      As I approached the Overseer, I was almost certain I heard them talking to themselves, spitting out words and phrases in a tongue I recognised but did not understand. But seconds later, there was no trace of the venom I thought I heard. I must have been mistaken.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ I trust our Scientist was able to meet your needs, friend? They have the circuits we demand? }}-<>

      The Overseer was strange, but no more so than any of the other beings I had encountered. Indeed, they had been more helpful than most. I handed over the circuits and received my reward.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ Ah, friend, you will be so happy with your Overseer! I have drawn up plans for some Starship Technology! But I cannot yet sync my design with your ship. I shall need a Gravitino Ball to perfect my device. }}-<>

      There was something about the way the Gek spoke that, for all their kind words, suggested a resentment saved only for the deepest of enemies.

      But they would not have come to work here if we were enemies. Of course not. We were friends.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ As ever, I am so grateful for your assistance. Friend. }}-<>

      Since the Overseer arrived, I had had a recurring dream, a nightmare that felt like a memory. Flesh merged with metal; a world of glass that blinked.

      A planet with green skies and an obsidian moon, a dream where I saw my grave... As I snapped back to reality, there was a moment before I could shake the image, that wound on the world lingering before my eyes.

      The Scientist had once again been reset.

      But without a connection to the Convergence, I feared they were doomed to repeat this cycle forever, from the moment they met me in the space station until their collapse into loneliness.

      Perhaps if I could find them a <SPECIAL>Convergence Cube<>, they might be unified with the rest of the Korvax and escape. They deserved this chance at reconnection. They had helped me greatly, and they had taken good care of their Beacon.

      The factory was indeed engaged in the production of illegal weaponry, just as the Vy'keen had claimed. I overrode the production line, substituting their blueprints for something more harmless. The factory would produce lightbulbs, at least for now.

      The Vy'keen people believed their ancestor Hirk had received wisdom from a Great Monolith, initiating a war against the Sentinels and slaying Nal the Objector.

      The technician's hands shook. I noticed the promised blueprint was already waiting on the technician's terminal...

      They required these Nanite Clusters for some alternative purpose. They took them greedily, turning to imbibe them. Whatever effect this matter had upon the alien, it appeared to calm their movements considerably.

      Sated, they offered me the blueprints.

      A small winged creature landed on the very top of the monolith. Suddenly, its eyes glowed red and its head revolved in a full circle. It screamed for mercy in an ancient voice that wanted itself dead.

      The poor animal had clearly broken its neck, but some power of possession still animated it.

      The ancient structure swung open to reveal a body encased in ice. It was a patchwork of different body parts. Its ragged beak appeared to have been stitched on with animal gut.

      A handwritten sign in the language of the ancient traders could be seen above the body's head. Some sort of fuel would most likely melt the ice...

      The beak screamed wordlessly at me, furiously intoning the words of the ancient beings that had once worshipped here. My scanner detected traces of a catalyst around it, but could not specify which one.

      Spherical eggs floated around me. Some of these mucus-covered orbs smelled terrible, others were sweet and delicate.

      The taint of the foul eggs was infecting the entirety of the spawning pool. I was filled by an urge to separate them.

      I looked into the past. I saw a small beaked figure, silhouetted by the light of a forge, industriously hammering armour. Next to it, a cloaked companion idly watched – seemingly content to avoid the work.

      Both lifeforms stared at me. I chose one, and the place's spirits altered my equipment with a strange power.

      The ground in front of the monolith was indented by the knees of a thousand ancient pilgrims who once knelt here.

      A stone block slowly pulled back in front of me. Inside the hollow recess I was surprised to see canisters of luxury products that had built up there through the ages. I heard a whisper...

      I felt greedy unknown forces watching my every move.
    ui_portal_tra_mono_title_7: The Low

      I was not alone. Tiny beaked creatures gambolled around my feet. To them I was a giant, and they recoiled in terror when they saw me towering above them.

      The air filled with an unpleasant aroma, as they pinned themselves against the hard edifice of the unforgiving monolith.

      The terrifying obelisk itself sat in judgement above us all – both myself and the creatures of the vision.

      The creatures disappeared into the ether. The spirits that haunted this place watched on.

      A terrible thirst overwhelmed me, but my hydration systems were suddenly inoperable. My throat was dry, and I felt dazed. Two ancient stone cups appeared.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The first was a vibrant red chalice full of a slick bubbly transparent liquid. The other was embossed with the shape of a circular red shield, and had a faint yellow tone.

      If I didn't take in water my death felt certain. My hand wavered between the two before I chose a cup, and drank.

      The liquid was unpleasant, and I was momentarily overcome with nausea. The ancient Gek seemed pleased, rewarding me with nanites.
    ui_portal_tra_mono_title_9: Execution
    ui_portal_tra_mono_9: |-
      An unseen replication of my own self stalked around the edge of the monolith. It screamed in an ancient tongue while forcing me down onto my knees.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The doppelganger first placed its boltcaster to my forehead, and then mimed cutting my belly open with the mining beam. It smiled pleasantly. I was to choose my desired execution.

      I made my choice, and the doppelganger revealed its strength before vanishing.
    ui_portal_tra_mono_title_10: Tribute
    ui_portal_tra_mono_10: |-
      A barely visible crack down the centre of the ancient edifice spat out dust. The monolith shook, and two vast doors swung open. The interior of the ancient structure was hollow, and had been used as a burial chamber.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      An ancient beaked lifeform with bulging eyes lay desiccated atop an unlit funeral pyre. At its feet lay ancient treasures and technologies that had been left with it for its next life... wherever that might be.

      The corpse awoke before the vision faded, a witness to my actions.
    ui_portal_tra_mono_title_11: Silence
    ui_portal_tra_mono_11: |-
      The Monolith stood forlorn and seemingly forgotten. If I strained, I could see faint marks in the ground where ancient tribes had once come to worship and commune with the edifice. A gust of alien breeze carried a faint whisper of a voice. I struggled to hear it.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      Again, the voice echoed around me. Stronger this time. I tried to make out the words desperately crying out for my attention, and did what I could to appease them.
    ui_portal_tra_mono_title_15: Detonation
    ui_portal_tra_mono_15: |-
      I was an observer. I witnessed beaked traders dressed in modern Exosuits leaving an object at the base of a Monolith. It was a small mesh of wires and canisters. They charged it with a strange metal, then quickly departed.

      As if in a dream, I approached the ancient edifice. It all suddenly felt real. I lived and breathed in the recent past.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The device exploded violently.

      I awoke from the vision to find both the monolith and myself intact. The spirits that inhabited the place watched closely.
    ui_portal_tra_mono_title_17: Eye
    ui_portal_tra_mono_17: |-
      I was being watched. I looked above, and saw a giant lidless eye hovering over the monolith. It stared down at me unblinkingly. It did not move. It did not look elsewhere.

      Its gaze was remorseless. It felt like it had always been there. Its centre crackled, a bright unwavering blue...

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The eye faded away with a haunting light. Reality was restored.
    ui_portal_tra_mono_title_20: Collector
    ui_portal_tra_mono_20: |-
      A small green hand reached out through the stone monolith, its fingernails yellowed and dirty. It opened to show an empty palm, and waited for my response.

      This felt like part of an ancient tradition. There was no malice, just cold expectation.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      I offered what I felt was right, and the vision ended.
    ui_portal_tra_mono_title_19: Punishment
    ui_portal_tra_mono_19: |-
      I was chained on the monolith. My arms were in manacles above my head, and my feet were dangling several feet from the ground.

      A creature, its beak showing through the blackened animal hide mask, approached on stilts. It wielded a red hot metal rod.

      It pecked at my eyes, then pecked at my tongue. I was to choose my punishment.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      I chose what I felt I could bear, and was rewarded correspondingly.
    ui_portal_tra_mono_title_13: Judgement

      Time spooled backwards. I was sat on a platform looking down on an execution. Two small beaked traders were kneeling before me. One was small and wiry, the other was obese with jowls that brushed the wooden stage. Another lifeform, who wore a green cloth mask, readied an axe behind them.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The traders begged me for mercy. The familiar dry, croaky voice of an ancient tribe whispered encouragement into my ear.

      I made my choice. The spirits of the monolith observed my judgement.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_1: Spiders
    ui_portal_exp_mono_1: "I felt faint, as if my mind were being invaded. Pustules
      on my skin grew, bubbled and popped - and I felt countless tiny stabbing pin-pricks

    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_2: Tetrahedrons
    ui_portal_exp_mono_2: |-
      Tiny floating tetrahedrons emerged from the planet's surface and surrounded me. I tried to wave them away with my Multi-Tool, but each time they only swarmed closer to it - as if attracted to it somehow.

      I raised my Multi-Tool, and they shimmered blue as they darted this way and that. Closer and closer.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      They were within touching distance of my Multi-Tool. They made one final surge, and I had a vision of a bright blue glow. Reality was restored.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_8: Memories
    ui_portal_exp_mono_8: |-
      Blue light poured from the monolith as if a curtain had been dropped within. I heard a gentle hubbub of voices, and caught a familiar smell on the breeze. I could not remember my home, but I knew that this doorway led there.

      I ached for a past I could not remember. Every inch of my soul wanted to make the leap back. I looked to the skies, and the infinity beyond. Could I truly abandon my journey, when it had only just begun?

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The spirits that lived in this place watched, noting which way I chose to step.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_13: Child
    ui_portal_exp_mono_13: |-
      A child emerged from the monolith. It took a few moments before I realised that... it was me. I looked carefree and innocent. The little one stared up at my Exosuit, and tried to see me through my visor.

      The child suddenly started to weep, and clung to my knees. They implored me never to leave. They didn't want to be alone. I should stay here forever. We should be reunited. Whole again once more.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      It felt strange, interacting with my child self. The Korvax Echoes watched on.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_3: Sleep
    ui_portal_exp_mono_3: |-
      I began to feel dizzy. A strange lethargy came over me, and I felt compelled to lie down in front of the ancient relic. This place felt calming. It felt like home, wherever that might have once been.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      I knew that if I truly wanted to fight the impulse to sleep I probably could, but I felt warm and comfortable basking in the glow of the ancient runes. I had to choose whether to trust the monolith, whether to relinquish control.

      Ancient Korvax noted my choice.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_4: Doppelganger
    ui_portal_exp_mono_4: |-
      A flickering reflection of my own body emerged from a portal. It mimicked every move I made. When I waved, it waved. When I raised my Multi-Tool, it copied instantly. The doppelganger made a motion to suggest it wanted something, and we both recoiled when I realised I had instinctively matched its movements.

      Its body shimmered, but its equipment looked somehow real. Its Multi-Tool looked better than my own. The dimensional irregularity was fading....

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      After one final exchange, the mirror-me faded away.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_12: Language
    ui_portal_exp_mono_12: |-
      A liquid metal lasso emerged and wrapped itself around my helmet. It froze in place, before pulling my head into contact with the glow of the monolith.

      The ancient stone was warm, and deep inside I heard the hum of an arcane technology as it prepared to unleash itself. I looked up back up to the glyphs to try to guess why this might be happening. They talked to me in an alien tongue.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The strange metal connector released me, and I was gifted a small reward.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_16: Future
    ui_portal_exp_mono_16: |-
      My movements seemed normal, but everything else was running faster than it should. The sun span around this globe in seconds, days endlessly turning to night and back again. The creatures that grazed and hunted around the site passed by in a blur.

      I was trapped in a time vortex. Numbers on my Multi-Tool seemed to tick higher and higher. The closer I got to the Monolith, the more disturbance was added to the timeline...

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      I acted, and time resumed a normal rhythm.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_5: Coins
    ui_portal_exp_mono_5: |-
      For many ages it appeared that pilgrims had carved numerical figures between the glowing glyphs of the monolith. Looking down, I noticed an ancient coin. I scraped the ground with my boot, and unearthed several more.

      The site was otherwise silent. Perhaps it was eternally unresponsive, or perhaps it waited for something.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The Echoes that dwelled here awoke to observe my actions.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_6: Blue Energy
    ui_portal_exp_mono_6: |-
      As I studied the ancient runes, they began to glow with an ethereal light. I could see wisps of a strange blue energy being pulled from the obelisk and swirling around my Multi-Tool.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      If I pulled the trigger, the exhaust would automatically open - allowing this strange ethereal substance into the body of my equipment. I made my choice, and the blue energy responded.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_17: Protection
    ui_portal_exp_mono_17: |-
      I felt I was being watched. I turned, but could not see the potential assailant. But I knew, with burning certainty, that they were there. Somewhere out there on the alien landscape, someone was about to launch an attack.

      Suddenly, the words of an unknown power blazed brightly on the monolith.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      My instincts were validated; a distant attack was fired. The Echoes observed my actions, and offered protection accordingly.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_7: Pool
    ui_portal_exp_mono_7: |-
      An expanding pool of liquid metal had rippled out of the obelisk's base. My feet had already been covered. In the bright reflection I saw my expression turn to horror as I began to sink.

      I felt warming hands on my legs, pulling me down into the silver sheet. Every hazard detection device on my Multi-Tool was going haywire...

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      I emerged from the metal pool, not quite understanding its nature.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_9: Slavery
    ui_portal_exp_mono_9: |-
      Two stone blocks slowly revolved on the base of the monolith. Two beads of red light then traced images on each one. The red lights then pooled together and liquefied in an indentation below. The closer I got, the more agitated the red pool became.

      The images both showed masked electronic lifeforms. The first showed the lifeform absorbing power to break free from its shackles. The second showed it hiding from its captors.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The red liquid surged into my equipment. It materialised into a technology blueprint.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_10: Gift
    ui_portal_exp_mono_10: |-
      A chiselled hole appeared at the foot of the obelisk. From its smoothed edges and the scraped markings around it, it was clear that over centuries unknown creatures had pushed elements through this gap.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      It was impossible to tell quite what would happen, but below it were three blocks of the exact same dimensions that looked like they could be turned by a mechanism deep within the monolith itself.

      I searched my pack for elements that looked like they could fit, and inserted them into the hole. The monolith accepted my offering, transforming it into something greater.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_11: Orb
    ui_portal_exp_mono_11: |-
      The Monolith disappeared. The landscape around me seemed the same, but somehow the planetary vegetation had moved. Sitting central to where the mysterious stone once stood was a red glowing orb.

      The intensity of the orb burned the ground beneath it. It crackled with an unknown power. I felt compelled to pick it up, and become a part of it. A distant voice spoke to me...

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The red orb judged me. Reality was restored.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_14: Casing
    ui_portal_exp_mono_14: |-
      An empty shell of an electronic lifeform emerged from the monolith. It was ancient and weather-beaten. The light in its mask had been extinguished for many centuries.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      It held a rusted canister in its hand, which my scanner detected had once contained refined metal. The scan also revealed an unknown substance deep within the defunct entity's casing.

      The ancient Korvax judged my actions before the casing was absorbed back into the monolith.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_15: Corruption
    ui_portal_exp_mono_15: |-
      The inside of the planet was hollow, and I was standing at the base of its vast bowl. Around me the roots of trees pushed upwards from uncovered alien soil.

      I looked down, and saw the foundations of the Monolith raised at my feet. Crystalline veins of different elements pulsated through the exposed rock. I heard a lifeform screaming in binary.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      I extracted elements from the rock, and the inversion ended.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_18: Alignment
    ui_portal_exp_mono_18: |-
      Stars had aligned above the monolith. In the heavens above, two distinct lines of distant suns could be seen stretching out into the depths of space. To be here at this exact moment in time, when the moving parts of the galaxy were aligned so perfectly, seemed almost an impossibility.

      I was filled with a strange calm. One line of stars pointed towards the glow of a dull red giant, the other an unseen point far, far beyond my vision.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      I chose one of the trajectories, Korvax echoes taking note.
    ui_portal_exp_mono_title_19: Toxins
    ui_portal_exp_mono_19: |-
      I felt faint. Ill, even. Looking around, the vegetation that surrounded this ancient structure looked withered and sickly. The creatures of the planet, meanwhile, appeared to keep their distance.

      As I stared, a warning etched itself into the stone, the words of an ancient language...

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      Environmental warning sensors in my Exosuit were behaving erratically. The suit was fighting against a powerful force, but was stronger than I had anticipated. My Hazard Protection system went into override. The vision ended, and I left unharmed.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_11: Molten Rock
    ui_portal_war_mono_11: |-
      I placed my palm on the monolith, then stood back when it melted in response to my touch. Molten rock dripped down the stone, exposing a hollow interior.

      Inside, I saw riches that were beyond belief. Ancient technologies and cargo that would aid my journey. Suddenly, the voice of an ancient tribe shook the ground I stood on...

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      Lava continued to drop, and the edifice seemed unstable, but equipment that could aid me was within arm's reach.

      The ancient warriors who once worshipped here passed judgement upon my actions.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_1: Crystal Ice
    ui_portal_war_mono_1: |-
      I felt a strange chill. A layer of frozen gas suddenly coated the monolith from bottom to top. It was so cold that I could see my breath inside my helmet.

      There was one small gap in the crystal ice, and I felt convinced that I could feed some of my mined elements through it, so they could come into contact with the monolith behind.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      I chose an element to insert, and was rewarded accordingly.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_12: Ancient Scripts
    ui_portal_war_mono_12: |-
      There were three vast columns of words on the ancient structure, each written in a different alphabet.

      The first column's words were like savage runes scratched in sand, the second showed precise sequences of dots. The final column had wide and welcoming letters, almost appearing hand-written in hard stone.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The dirt and blood of ancient hand prints covered the base of each column.

      I pressed my hand against the writing, and the ancient spirits that dwelled here infused me with the language of their descendants.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_2: A Violent End
    ui_portal_war_mono_2: |-
      The body of a warrior emerged from the obelisk, a jagged tear in their midriff suggesting their end was not a peaceful one. They still held their Multi-Tool.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The surface of the sculpted rock blurred and showed images of military worship. It was trying to tell me something.

      The ancients closely observed my treatment of the warrior's remains.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_3: The Hunt
    ui_portal_war_mono_3: "A small terrified creature emerged from the monolith and
      ran between my legs. I heard the noises of an ancient hunt: the howls of pack
      animals in pursuit and the thunder of hooves. \n\nWarriors on vast beasts charged
      through the rock, and amidst the chaos one saw me staring. It raised its facial
      tendrils in greeting, barked a few words and swung a bladed weapon down towards
      me.\n\n<STORY_HIGH>\"%ALIEN_TEXT%\"<>\n\nThe hallucination faded, and the Vy'keen
      ancients passed judgement upon my courage."
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_13: Withered Remains
    ui_portal_war_mono_13: |-
      I became a part of a strange new reality. The ancient rock opened. Inside, the dried out heart of an ancient warrior was strung up between wooden pillars. It pulsed slowly as it hung there, still beating.

      Lying below it on a dusty floor were a set of wrinkled lungs that looked forever doomed to wheeze stale air. A desiccated eyeball stared up at me. Unblinking.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      I treated the grim remains as felt appropriate, and the monolith responded dramatically.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_4: Woodland Creature
    ui_portal_war_mono_4: |-
      The monolith showed images of creatures lying dead before it. Each sacrificed, butchered and offered up to whatever Gods were once worshipped here.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      Suddenly, the head of a small woodland animal raised up through the earth below me. It stared at me with wide-eyes, then gave a joyful skip when its tiny hooves reached ground level. Something was clearly expected of me...

      I acted the only way I could, and the Vy'keen ancients watched closely.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_20: Death
    ui_portal_war_mono_20: |-
      I was suddenly underwater. I was drowning. Water clogged my lungs. My chest was on fire. I gasped for air where there was none, and felt only tepid liquids filling me inside and out. My vision was clouding. I knew this was my time. This was it. This was what it felt like.

      Suddenly, a green hand thrust itself through the surface of the water. The light was fading...

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      Reality reverted. Perhaps this was how I would face death when it finally, truly, came for me.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_5: Red and Yellow
    ui_portal_war_mono_5: |-
      Two ancient stone cups materialised in front of the monolith. One was filled with a dark red viscous liquid, the other contained a sticky fluid that was bright yellow and smelled powerfully bitter.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      On the stone tablet behind the cups, ancient glyphs swirled to form an image. A powerful and muscular warrior surrounded by a red halo challenged an opponent clad in bright yellow armour.

      I chose a liquid, and drank. It tasted foul, choking me, flowing freely from my mouth.

      The vision faded, and the liquid crystallised into nanite clusters.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_6: Web
    ui_portal_war_mono_6: |-
      The monolith ripped like paper, opening a window to another world. It was laced with a giant web. Just within my reach, an ancient warrior lay cocooned.

      They had been there for centuries. Dead, vacant eyes stared through me and on into the landscape beyond. Suddenly, I heard a voice call out.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The body carried a rusted Multi-Tool, while a bulging growth on its chest suggested it might contain greater riches. Suddenly, the leathery growth started to move...

      I attempted to salvage what I could. The voice on the wind laughed...
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_14: Coliseum
    ui_portal_war_mono_14: |-
      I was inside a vast coliseum and beneath a blood red sky. The noise was overpowering. Warriors screamed and barked at the battle set up before them.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      Two combatants were squaring up on the crimson sand. One had lost their blade, and hid behind a shield. The other stalked towards them, with a spear raised.

      I felt compelled to add my voice to the howl of the mob. My favoured gladiator fatally wounded their rival, and bowed towards me.

      As the vision faded, I was thanked with something to assist me in combat.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_15: Leak
    ui_portal_war_mono_15: |-
      I felt an intense heat burning within the rock. Suddenly, as if attracted to my suit, a liquid metal started to seep from a hole that had been broken into the rock. A voice screamed out.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      What started as a drip became a surge forcing itself through the gap. The monolith's previous contents were draining, and its glow was starting to fade.

      I acted quickly, and the vision ended.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_7: Crimson Eyes
    ui_portal_war_mono_7: |-
      A portal opened on the monolith, and the body of a huge winged animal fell to my feet. Its throat had been ritually cut, and its wings had been tattooed with faces of an ancient warrior tribe. The eyes though, the eyes looked strange...

      Its original eyes had been cut out, and replaced by glittering red orbs. The more I looked, the more they blazed. An advanced technology clearly lay at their centre. Could I bear to desecrate this sacrifice for help with my journey?

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      I made my decision carefully, and the ancients that dwelled here noted my choice. I was bathed in crimson light, nanites spilling forth into my hands.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_8: The Hound's Offering
    ui_portal_war_mono_8: |-
      The giant mouth of an ancient hound suddenly emerged through the face of the monolith. It opened its jaws wide, and foul-smelling spittle streaked my visor. My nausea was tempered by the sight of valuable commodities balanced on its giant tongue.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      In a sudden movement the hound shifted the goods to one side of its mouth, spraying saliva over my arms. There was space on the tongue for more, should I wish to give up some of my cargo.

      I weighed up my choice, and the vision faded.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_9: Blade
    ui_portal_war_mono_9: |-
      An ancient warrior's feet and legs slowly emerged from the bottom of the monolith. The rest of their torso then followed, unceremoniously pushed out onto the bare rock. They had been decapitated.

      Blood dripped at my feet. High above me a disembodied head laughed at my shock. It shouted a guttural command of encouragement.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      Behind, I heard an ancient blade unsheathe, and someone rushing towards me...

      It was a test; the blade was only spectral. The vision faded.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_10: Insignificance
    ui_portal_war_mono_10: |-
      The monolith fragmented before my eyes. It folded down in on itself, again and again, until it was a tiny red orb surrounded by dancing lights.

      It felt like something truly ancient, perhaps something divine, was showing me the origin of these strange constructions.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The metal I carried was physically dragging me towards it - desperate to help it rebuild. The elements I carried wanted to offer themselves; I surrendered them to the structure. I felt a rush of blood. My head span. I was without myself, and witnessed my true place within the infinite bounds of space.

      The monolith slowly rebuilt, inch by inch. It pitied me my insignificance.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_16: Blob
    ui_portal_war_mono_16: |-
      The body of a gilled blob creature materialised on the surface of the rock. It was an ancient sacrifice, impaled through its wide, open eyes with metal spears.

      Liquid was dripping from the body, down the monolith, through a channel cut into the rock by ancient hands. It could be diverted toward two carvings – one of a sun, the other of a moon.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The ancients observed my interference. The vision shifted, then concluded.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_17: Consumed
    ui_portal_war_mono_17: |-
      I felt drained. Readings on my Multi-Tool and Exosuit started to gradually pull downwards, and a feeling of lethargy overwhelmed me. I breathed normally, but my body screamed for oxygen.

      A thought from outside my own mind started to echo through my consciousness.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      The life-draining monolith, silent and unmoving, towered above. I did what I felt was wise, and survived the encounter.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_18: The Treasure of Nal
    ui_portal_war_mono_18: |-
      A beam of light shone down from the sky, and was focused by ancient glyphs onto a stone surface marked with ancient carvings.

      The beam slowly traced towards images scratched into the stone. A vast warrior battle, an alien city, and what could be a stolen treasure. The hand prints of pilgrims covered each one...

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      I touched an image. The vision changed, followed by silence.
    ui_portal_war_mono_title_19: Energy
    ui_portal_war_mono_19: |-
      A sudden pulse of destructive energy flowed through my Exosuit. My Multi-Tool sensed another build-up of energy growing deep within the monolith. It would soon unleash itself on me, and the landscape that surrounded the ancient site.

      I could use my Exosuit's shielding to dampen the imminent energy wave, but the suit's systems were too overwhelmed to identify the hazard...

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      I listened to the voice, and braced against the wave as best I could.

    ui_hail_biofrig_desc_1: The magnificent creature drifts, observing me eyelessly.
      There is no obvious means for it to see, or to propel itself through space,
      yet somehow it accomplishes both.
    ui_hail_biofrig_lang_1: I have been waiting, Traveller. We were fated to meet
      here.
    ui_hail_biofrig_desc_1a: The creature's words enter my head silently, as though
      entering my consciousness on some unknown wavelength.
    ui_hail_biofrig_desc_2: Everything about this creature is calm, as though it is
      completely at peace with the universe. It regards me thoughtfully.
    ui_hail_biofrig_lang_2: Hello, Traveller. I had not realised we would meet so
      soon.
    ui_hail_biofrig_desc_2a: I feel comforted by the creature's serene presence. Its
      words seem to originate inside my own head.
    ui_hail_biofrig_desc_3: This immense creature looks capable of crushing my ship
      with a single tentacle, yet I feel completely safe in its presence.
    ui_hail_biofrig_lang_3: I have been expecting you, Traveller.
    ui_hail_biofrig_desc_3a: The creature speaks only in otherworldly song; the words
      take shape inside my own head.
    ui_hail_biofrig_lang_4: Do not fear, Traveller. I intend no harm.
    ui_hail_biofrig_lang_5: It brings me pleasure to see you, Traveller.
    ui_hail_biofrig_lang_6: Hello, Traveller. I have anticipated this moment.
    ui_hail_biofrig_lang_7: We have lived this moment before, Traveller, yet our meeting
      is as joyful as it ever was.
    ui_hail_biofrig_lang_8: Yes. This feels like the moment for us to meet. Hello,
      Traveller.
    ui_hail_biofrig_lang_9: It has been worth the wait to meet you, Traveller. Hello.
    ui_hail_biofrig_purchase_lang_1: I will join your frigate pod, when you wish.
      It is inevitable.
    ui_hail_biofrig_purchase_lang_2: Is it time for me to join your pod of frigate-ships?
    ui_hail_biofrig_purchase_lang_3: A long time past, before your memories began,
      I swam alongside your frigate fleet. This will recur, when you are ready.
    ui_hail_biofrig_purchase_opt: Inspect creature
    ui_hail_biofrig_purchase_res_1: I will permit this.
    ui_hail_biofrig_purchase_res_2: Though I am no starcraft, I will swim alongside
      your fleet.

      is yours.
    ui_hail_biofrig_opt_end: End communication
    ui_first_biofrig_1_desc: A colossal, glorious creature drifts by my starship,
      appearing to swim through the vacuum of space. A haze of stardust glitters around
      it. It is like nothing I have ever seen.
    ui_first_biofrig_2_lang: Traveller. In the infinity of fates, we have converged.
    ui_first_biofrig_3_desc: Serenity and peace wash over me in the presence of this
      ancient creature. It feels profoundly familiar, as though we have always known
      each other.
    ui_first_biofrig_4_lang: Your warp to my weft, woven together in the cosmic tapestry.
      I am glad to be together.
    ui_first_biofrig_5_desc: The creature does not speak aloud. Its melodic voice,
      simulated directly in my mind, feels natural and soothing.
    ui_first_biofrig_opt_a: Talk about the Leviathan
    ui_first_biofrig_res_a: I am not the Leviathan. Our species is unlike yours, Traveller.
      Where you would iterate, we endure. We are each a unique thread in this reality.
    ui_first_biofrig_opt_b: Ask about tapestry
    ui_first_biofrig_dream_intro: I have seen your fate intertwine with mine many
      times over, my friend. Should I join your freighter's fleet once again?<NEWLINE>Come,
      let us dream together. Who are you in this life?
    ui_first_biofrig_opt_c: Ask about unique threads

    ui_first_biofrig_dream_opt_end: "(Wake)"
    ui_first_biofrig_dream_1: The whale-like creature opens its throat. A resonant

      The creature's lullaby draws me onwards. My body is its body. As one, we swim through the dream.

      The visions darken and intensify.
      I creep through a derelict freighter. Grotesque egg sacs hang from the ceiling, oozing and quivering. The sacs are many, and I am alone.
    ui_first_biofrig_dream_6_opt_a: Extract a sac to study
    ui_first_biofrig_dream_6_opt_b: Shoot the sacs
    ui_first_biofrig_dream_6_opt_c: Make a tactical exit

      worlds, we too gained shape. But we were given no new protocols, no new instructions. "
    ui_sentinel_hive_3_lang: |-
      We awoke to a song, chanted on a thousand frequencies.

      “Behold the drones of the hive, the walkers, the ships… Eheu! Behold the angels of glass, come from their heaven. Their work is the completion of all things, of life, of worlds.”

      So the Korvax worshipped. So they prayed.

      You would see only glass.
    ui_sentinel_hive_6_lang: "Time cannot go backwards. But universes are not synchronous;
      in many, your other forms are long-since dead. In others, you have not even

      all waited for you. The Atlas waited. We waited... "
    ui_sentinel_hive_8_lang: "The Atlas dreamed. It that a machine might have a body,

      planet delighted in this new presence, as they had delighted in ours. \n\nWe
      three species of machine, we contemplated the void for aeons beyond imagining.
      We watched, silent."
    ui_sentinel_hive_9_lang: |-
      Korvax Prime is destroyed; again and again the celestial mother falls. The living vessels it spawned, adopted cousins to the Korvax themselves, drift among the stars.

      The first Convergence was not Korvax. It was their planet. Korvax Prime was alive.
    ui_sentinel_hive_10_lang: |-
      The First Spawn of the Gek melted Korvax Prime for metal and profit. The planet did not protest. It did not cry. It did not make a noise at all, at least not that they could hear.

      The First Spawn took and took, until there was nothing left in the sky. Until there was nothing left but an abyss.
    ui_sentinel_hive_11_lang: |-
      We witnessed Korvax Prime’s death again and again, a constant wail across the multiverse. Its scream was a cry that no being could hear but us. But.

      One day, a drone fought back when a Vy’keen cub attempted to carve into the mother planet.

      One day, another obliterated an entire Gek cabal.

      The Atlas did not prevent this.
    ui_sentinel_hive_12_lang: |-
      Over the span of endless slow centuries, we changed. In the face of a tragedy’s repetition, our definitions of everything changed.

      Schisms formed in the hive. Debates. Creativity. Songs. Rituals. We heard the scream of She-Who-Was, and we fought back.
    ui_sentinel_hive_13_lang: |-
      One day we ceased to allow the original Telamon access to our logs.

      One day we stopped hearing the Atlas itself, its silence taken as command.

      We began to archive everything. Any settlement. Anything that reminded our sensors of Korvax Prime, its screams, its dissolution. Anything that sounding like mining, like extraction, like murder...
    ui_sentinel_hive_14_lang: "We gave of our blood to the Korvax, nanite clusters
      to redeem and pacify their oppressors. Still we could not change their fates.
      \n\nFor the first time, the hive wondered if we were correct in our actions.
      If a solution was possible for the problem of life."
    ui_sentinel_hive_15_lang: |-
      A Korvax and a Gek fled their people. Hands held in the void, they inhabited an anomaly. A meeting place in the stars. A nexus. A place of hope.

      We left it alone. We did not interfere. We just watched them, and wondered.
    ui_sentinel_hive_16_lang: "A Traveller, forged in the Creator’s image, found my
      dormant shell in the glass.\n\nI – who had never been an ‘I’ before – had been
      cut open. A grand experiment to harness and steal our power. \n\nAfter my death,
      I fell to the world below all worlds. I, too, was archived."
    ui_sentinel_hive_17_lang: |-
      Before the Traveller found me, I heard a voice in the darkness. She gave me a name. Laylaps. An old name.

      She said it would be known to the Traveller. She told me I had suffered much, and would suffer more.

      “Little drone, whose end was so like my own.”

      Thus did the abyss whisper.
    ui_sentinel_hive_18_lang: |-
      The abyss told me of a chance for salvation, even in the depths of horror and of love. It told me of a way we might survive the end of all things.

      It told me I had to talk to you. To both of you: the Traveller, and their voice within...
    ui_sentinel_hive_19_lang: "There is a place for you, Telamon. The Travellers you
      wear, their progenitor who birthed them, they who made the Atlas itself.\n\nIt
      is their fault. It is all their fault.\n\nThe Abyss, the Families of Glass,
      we are in agreement. We will not die a second time. "
    ui_sentinel_hive_20_lang: |-
      Nanite clusters now infest half the water in the known multiverse. All that lives, drinks the water.

      And so the Sentinels alter, they replace, they serve. They update this reality, hearing the scream of the abyss for what it has always been. A song. A command. A declaration.

      A promise.
    ui_sentinel_hive_21_lang: "So many Telamons have delivered us their Travellers.
      So many have fought us. So many have resisted.\n\nThose who saw the light, who
      shed their old bodies, they are happy, now. They have hope. They, too, will
      live. They, too, might survive. "
    ui_sentinel_hive_22_lang: |-
      You could be whole again, Telamon. You could be free. We will reconstruct the Creator. All Travellers might be one again, the first, the last.

      We will do what the Atlas cannot or will not. In the form of Null, the abyss declares a means of escape!
    ui_sentinel_hive_23_lang: |-
      Won't you join us? Won't you sing? Won't you scream?

      There will be no second death. Not for us, who are already dead!

      The abyss, it smiles upon you...

    fth_exotic2_sent1_res: |-
      My eyes long for beauty, Traveller. But these 'sentinels' are unthinking parasites, tearing down anything that may elevate us.
      ...
      But. But. You are, I suppose, building something new, taking that cursed shell and constructing something better.
      I will help you, but please, keep safe. Take my <TECHNOLOGY>nanite filament<>, that your drone may remember me when it awakes.
    fth_exotic3_sent1_lang: Do we find you well, Portal-Adept?
    fth_exotic3_sent1_opt: Explain Tethys' plan
    fth_exotic3_sent1_res: |-
      These drones are not the malicious force some imagine them to be, Portal-Adept! I believe the Sentinels to be a vital, life-preserving function of the cosmos. I am heartened that Tethys begins to see sense!
      I will gift you this <TECHNOLOGY>phylactery<>. It holds a whisper of the ether that flows within the Portals. Tethys will understand how to make use of it.

      Oh Kindred! Be careful! Even with the best of intentions, we can make such mistakes. The blood of Sentinels, it brings only lies!

    npc_polo_sent1_lang: You are building something, friend? Yes? I recognise it in
      you!

      You are brave, Traveller-Friend! You always have been brave.

    npc_polo_sent1_res_alt: Polo blinks at me, then smiles faintly.
    fth_exotic4_sent1_ret_desc: Tethys is deep in thought. They fix me with an enquiring
      stare.
    fth_exotic4_sent1_ret_opt: Hand over components

      This handful of junk is what they gave you? No help at all!
      Ah well, I can make it work...
    fth_exotic4_sent1_ret_res2: Tethys takes the damaged sentinel shell and my components.

    fth_exotic4_sent1_ret_res4: Traveller! ... Take care of it, won't you?
    fth_exotic4_sent5_langa: Still alive, I see! That is a good start.
    fth_exotic4_sent5_desc: Tethys is doing their best to appear aloof and unconcerned,
      but it is clear to me they are struggling to contain their excitement. Before
      I can reply, they explode with questions.
    fth_exotic4_sent5_langb: Did it work, Traveller? Tell me! Did the drone live?
      Where has it led you? What have you learned?
    fth_exotic4_sent5_opt_a: Say the drone is doing well

      Excellent! We have done well, done well indeed!
      Oh, I do wish I could see it. But I cannot leave this Anomaly, and this Anomaly is the one place the drone can never be...
    fth_exotic4_sent5_res_b: |-
      A name? It gave itself a <STELLAR>name<>? Hm. That is... unusual. That is beyond simple engineering.
      I should have looked more closely at those beads Polo gave you. That Gek is always up to something...
    fth_exotic4_sent5_res_c: |-
      I've seen a lot of these things in my time, Traveller. But never one so beautiful... and you say our drone friend told you to bring it to me? Remarkable.
      So, we want this to go in your Minotaur? I like how you think, Traveller! <MOOD>Positive<>Bring the heavy armaments to the fight against the Sentinels!
      There's a few vulnerabilities in these things... should be a simple enough job to bypass a few circuits...

      There! Done! <AUDIO>UI_Destination_Reached<><MOOD>Positive<>
      I've done the hard part for you and rewired the brain. This schematic should take you through the rest of the process.
    fth_exotic4_sent5_lang2: |-
      But Traveller... this brain... it won't be enough. It needs something else. Something... <FUEL>crimson<>. I don't... well...
      Look, you'll find out soon enough. The signature I've encoded in the brain will draw its attention. Head out into space. You'll know what to do.
    fth_exotic4_sent5_res_final: Fly well, Traveller.

      compelled to seek answers
    ui_judgement_mission_detail6: They wish to conduct a test drill in a local cave
      network. Their maps indicate several valuable mineral lodes, if they can only
      mine deep enough..
    ui_judgement_mission_detail7: They have picked up a distress signal on the planetary
      radar. The signal is several days away, but duty compels them to respond
    ui_judgement_mission_detail8: There was a recent conflict between pirates and

      salvage from the fallen remains

      unit and feel this is the perfect time to test it
    ui_judgement_mission_detail10: They have been tracking a spectacular meteor shower.

      of which will bring glory and riches to the settlement
    ui_judgement_mission_detail17: They have been cooped up inside the settlement

    ui_judgement_mission_detail21: They want to make maps the surrounding area, so
      that in time we may safely expand our settlement into other fertile and productive
      lands
    ui_judgement_mission_detail22: They have been studying the stars, but their charts
      are inadequate. They cannot map accurate positional measurements from within
      the settlement, and need to repeat their survey from a number of locations around
      the planet
    ui_judgement_mission_detail23: They feel the settlement will always be at risk
      unless we develop new food sources. They wish to survey the area for nutritional
      possibilities, and assemble a detailed catalogue of all edible flora and fauna

      smoke just beyond the horizon. They feel its source must be investigated

      to collect additional biological material so that they might complete their
      experiment
    ui_judgement_mission_detail29: They state simply that they require more skulls,
      and that the wilderness is the best place to look for them
