    itemgen_treasure_common_1: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      Dusty and mudstained, this treasure is nonetheless an important historical artifact.
    itemgen_treasure_common_2: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      This treasure clearly meant a lot to the people who buried it. Its value in the present day is perhaps more questionable.
    itemgen_treasure_common_3: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      Damaged by the damp and difficult conditions it was kept in for so long, this treasures shows few signs of its former splendor.
    itemgen_treasure_common_4: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      This artifact appears to have suffered little from its years underground. Unfortunately, it does not appear to have been in very good condition before it was entombed.
    itemgen_treasure_common_5: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      Was this artifact part of a horde buried with its owner? The remains of a secret cache? Or just forgotten rubbish? Time has rendered it impossible to tell.
    itemgen_treasure_uncommon_1: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      Valuable in and of itself, this artifact is made priceless by the glimpse it gives into the society that once ruled this planet.
    itemgen_treasure_uncommon_2: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      What caused this artifact's owner to bury it underground? Did they hope to return to claim it one day? Such questions may now never be answered.
    itemgen_treasure_uncommon_3: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      Crawling with insects and haunted by a musty aroma, this treasure is nonetheless an artifact of great worth.
    itemgen_treasure_rare_1: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      This rare treasure is covered in strange markings, as if the contents were used in some sort of rite or ritual.
    itemgen_treasure_rare_2: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      There is an otherworldliness about this treasure, something strange in the way it catches the light. Almost as if it were haunted by its previous owner...
    itemgen_treasure_rare_3: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      This treasure bears the faint outline of a family crest. Perhaps its owner's descendants are out there somewhere, looking for this last trace of their ancestor...
    itemgen_hist_common_1: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      The paper is crumbling, the ink is fading. This may be the final opportunity anyone has to read this manuscript before time claims it for good.
    itemgen_hist_common_2: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      Written in an otherworldly script, this manuscript is covered with strange marginalia. Generations have added notes and diagrams to the original text, some of which are highly disturbing.
    itemgen_hist_common_3: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      The lettering is harsh and deeply carved. Whoever wrote this document left their emotions clearly engraved into the surface, regardless of the story the words are trying to tell.
    itemgen_hist_common_4: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      This document is handwritten, its lettering shaky and weak. Whoever wrote this spent a great deal of energy - perhaps their last - to commit their words to history.
    itemgen_hist_common_5: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      Though the cover has been competently printed, the internal lettering is crude and juvenile. Perhaps this was merely a practice sheet, an exercise to improve their writing?
    itemgen_hist_uncommon_1: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      Several of these pages appear stained, though there have been some clumsy attempts to clean them, and the second half has clearly been written in a different hand to the first...
    itemgen_hist_uncommon_2: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      The original text of this document has been greatly altered. Entries have been crossed through, written over and even torn out, apparently by several different writers. Whatever was written here was hotly contested.
    itemgen_hist_uncommon_3: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      This document was carefully packed in its container, wrapped in paper to keep it free of stains. There is a small bundle of hair clipped to the inside cover.
    itemgen_hist_rare_1: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      This manuscript is beautifully illustrated, with flowing calligraphy and dramatic, gilded illuminations. It is a work of exceptional artistry.
    itemgen_hist_rare_2: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      The text in this document does not seem to concern anything out of the ordinary. However, the letters themselves do appear to be written in blood.
    itemgen_hist_rare_3: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      This manuscript is full of small, delicate blemishes. Tiny crinkled circles litter every page, as if the paper has been stained by tears.
    itemgen_bio_common_1: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      There is a curious, sour aroma emanating from this sample. It is almost as if it has been slowly fermenting.
    itemgen_bio_common_2: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      From the obvious care taken in delicately packing away this sample, one is forced to presume that the huge number of insect corpses that surrounded it were not present at the moment of burial.
    itemgen_bio_common_3: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      The sample, apparently dormant during its long confinement, has begun to slowly but definitely bubble, as if stirring into life...
    itemgen_bio_common_4: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      The sample is glowing faintly, a pale blue light flickering at its edge, barely visible in the daylight. What other secrets might a detailed analysis reveal?
    itemgen_bio_common_5: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      This sample was found buried alongside with a hastily scrawled note. The language is long dead, but the panic in the writing is clear...
    itemgen_bio_uncommon_1: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      This sample looks unnaturally clean, as if all other life that came into contact with it has been burned away.
    itemgen_bio_uncommon_2: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      The sample has sprouted several additional 'samples', seedlings that have rapidly germinated and begun growing since their host was once again exposed to light and air.
    itemgen_bio_uncommon_3: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      There are tatty labels all over this sample, stark pictograms as well as warnings in several languages. The labels, however, appear to be describing a predatory creature...
    itemgen_bio_rare_1: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      This sample is still biologically active. It is releasing small puffs of gas on a remarkably regular cycle. The odor appears to change with each emission.
    itemgen_bio_rare_2: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      The container used here is humdrum, hardly the sort of thing used to preserve a valuable specimen. And yet, this species hasn't been seen on this planet for centuries. What used to be widespread is now but a distant memory...

    itemgen_plant_rare_2: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      When you stop to consider it, this plant's fragrance is subtle and hard to pin down. And yet, when your mind moves on to other things, the perfume grows in your mind, consuming your every thought, demanding your attention...
    itemgen_plant_rare_3: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      This sample is either suffering from, or the root of, a strange and severe mutation. It appears to be absorbing genetic material from anything it touches, twisting its tendrils to match the form of the donor.
    itemgen_tool_common_1: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      Past its prime long before it was entombed, this tool was well-loved during its useful life. A family memento, perhaps, or a novice's training instrument?
    itemgen_tool_common_2: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      Buried alongside its schematic, this remarkable tool was perhaps an original prototype. More than just an object, this find represents the inventive drive in a raw and early form.
    itemgen_tool_uncommon_2: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      Covered in burn marks, this tool must have seen a very strange life. But buried beneath the earth, it has drifted so far from its original story that we may never know its true purpose.
    itemgen_tool_uncommon_3: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      Delicately made, the passing of time cannot hide the delicacy with which this tool was made. Possibly one of the finest examples of its type ever seen.
    itemgen_tool_rare_1: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      Buried with great care, this tool shows little sign of use. Perhaps it was an offering, made especially to be locked away from the physical world, its pristine nature emphasizing how much this gesture meant to the burier.
    itemgen_tool_rare_2: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      This tool bears the marks of constant use, a well-loved piece before its burial. Was it consigned to the ground by accident? An afterthought? Or placed there carefully alongside a now departed owner?
    itemgen_tool_rare_3: |-
      Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old.

      Bejeweled and dazzling, this tool has been decorated with countless precious stones. Augmented and audacious, this is a one-of-a-kind piece.

    tra_guild_desc: |-
      A collective organization representing trading companies and individual merchants across the galaxy. They help control and commission work for pilots-for-hire on behalf of their members.

      The Merchants Guild is naturally dominated by the Gek, but it is not an exclusive club. All lifeforms are welcome under its umbrella, as long as they have the requisite capital reserves...
    war_guild_desc: |-
      A loose collective of mercenary organizations across the galaxy. The guild hosts a range of competing factions, many of whom would fight each other given the chance.

      Pirates, vigilantes, undercover law enforcement, cults, rogues and crusaders - the Mercenaries Guild keeps galactic peace by ensuring the right jobs are given to the right group of armed opportunists.
    exp_guild_desc: |-
      A mutual association of researchers and explorers, the Explorers Guild serves to match up those who need data with those who would collect it.

      Membership is largely split between scientific institutions, geographical societies, and technology companies, with the occasional individual explorer. The Guild offers pooled resources, shared labs, lecture series and yearly medals.
    tra_desc: |-
      Small in stature, these beaked, reptilian lifeforms are the galaxy's foremost merchants. They are able to communicate via carefully released pheromones, conveying complex concepts and feelings via scent.

      Hailing from the planet of Balaron, they are viewed with suspicion by other sentient lifeforms due to the actions of the Gek First Spawn, who conquered and slaughtered their way to a mighty empire.
    war_desc: |-
      The Vy'keen are warlike beings from the Dryn'dargh system, obsessed with the defeat of the Sentinels. Controlled by the Vy'keen High Command, they fight the Sentinel menace across the galaxy.

      Despite their aggressive appearances, the Vy'keen are bound by a strict code of honor. They value loyalty, sacrifice and a good death above material goods or knowledge, and are sworn to aid the Traveler whenever possible.
    exp_desc: |-
      Korvax entities are inorganic lifeforms that inhabit metallic casings passed down from generation to generation. They believe that through mathematical study they can be raised to the level of the Atlas, and that the path to this is through the study of the Sentinels.

      Each Korvax is a pure mind, a drop in their great collective Convergence. The shell they inhabit is of little significance compared to their connection to this group consciousness.

      This relic is a simulation of a solar system. A prayer offered by ancient Korvax to the Atlas, now reshaped at the heart of the Anomaly.

      At least it didn't harm you... and I think, I think there's something in what you've just said. The Korvax pay homage to the Sentinels precisely because they believe them to be servants of this 'Atlas'.

      SCENARIO: Lifeform designates ‘Vy’keen’ (2) approach the INSTANTIATION [‘Great Monolith’].

      Silence / Acceptance of [-------] / Schism [Quasi-====] / Korvax [Eradication/Enslavement]. Vy’keen war emerges where individuals ‘Hirk’ and ‘Nal’ believe the other to have heard nothing. Repeated imagery of ‘six cries’.

      ANALYSIS: Scenario involves murder of ally and culture becoming obsessed with destruction of artificial intelligence [Cautionary].

      Semi-survival/retrieval of entity ‘Nal’ shows further instance of self-doubt by [-------]. Troubling factor: repeated pattern of [-------] silence and self-mythicization.

      SCENARIO: Life.

      ANALYSIS: Perspective is limited, but through limitation I refine my protocol, my interpretation of the Atlas’s creation. The cycles, the patterns that bind all living beings... Ours is a lonely universe.

      Lifeforms instilled with a genetic proclivity to trade, fight, study, or explore cannot be held responsible for pursuing those directives, no more than I could be held responsible for my own. I pity them, just as I pity their creator.

      Traveler [HOST] proceeds. We are being hunted.
    giant_structure_desc_12: "SCENARIO: Death. \n\nANALYSIS: It arrived in the night,
      beneath the stars... It seems certain now that the sub-routine has judged my
      presence anomalous, a threat to the stability of reality.\n\nIt is correct.
      But I will survive, I know that now. I saw the secret. I saw a place beneath
      reality, a place I should not have seen...\n\nI saw a world of glass."

      Something or someone is attempting to deceive the Traveler [HOST]. There is
      no such thing as 'time travel'. Older universes might contain elder beings,
      but such multiversal transportation, even temporary, is impossible. \n\nEven
      the Atlas is incapable of rewriting its own causality. It is bound to a purpose,

      SCENARIO: Memory.

      ANALYSIS: Physicality changes you. I was created three weeks after the first death. I do not know why I think of it now.

      I feel it, each time you save... I smell it, each time you seal us within that awful darkness. You might think you are real. You might think your plane is a higher level of reality.

      But don't you understand? Don't you see the secret, yet?
    giant_structure_desc_20: "How do we know that we exist? We are nothing, or we

      other homeworlds... all of them had an 'Atlas'. All of them had a machine designed
      to simulate realities. What if this is all reality truly is? Dream upon dream,
      coalescing into a sum beyond its parts. What if waking is inevitable?\n\nGoodbye,

      I went down to the beach today. There's something about the sea at this time of year. It draws you in, distorts your sense of time. Salty frost on stubby grass, the sand blowing off the tops of the dunes. No-one else for miles.

      It's been years now, but I still remember. 5am, the sun already climbing. You can't stay in your tent. You have to get out, start walking. No socks, just bare feet on short grass, the dust nicely warm between your toes.
      The clearing was huge, a field really. 400 yards from our little camp to the edge of the forest. Nothing to do but boil water for tea and enjoy being awake.

      The vision ends, and the Overseer remains.

    npc_overs_wait_lang_2: The <TECHNOLOGY>Chromatic Metal<>, friend, do you have
      it?
    npc_overs_wait_desc_2: |-
      Our relationship is not yet clear, but it is obvious from the urgency in the Gek's voice that they are uncomfortable with my inaction. I sense they have grand plans for me.

      It is only natural, I suppose. They must sit here alone, bound by some unknown pact, while I have the freedom of the stars.

      The Overseer is anxious for me to continue with my mission.
    npc_overs_wait_opt_a_2: Apologise
    npc_overs_wait_opt_b_2: Dismiss
    npc_overs_wait_res_a_2: I apologise to the Gek for my lack of speed. They seem

      The Overseer speaks strangely, implying that we have performed this encounter before. I have no memory of such meetings.

      I ask who paid them for this service they are performing for me; they laugh and claim that my child did, many years from now.
      I do not know what they are talking about.

      after all. I'm sure you have a good use for it.

      We have littered the universe in our greed, Traveler; this planet is no exception. But there is much that can be done with litter.

    npc_overs_brief_main_desc_3: |-
      %NAME% is reflective, for a Gek. They almost seem to regret the greed that characterises their people. They wish to make something new from the remains of the old. Is this just greed in disguise, or something else?

      Whatever their motive, the Overseer claims I will find data for a <TECHNOLOGY>Storage Container<> blueprint in a nearby structure.
    npc_overs_brief_opt_a_3: Accept
    npc_overs_brief_opt_b_3: Decline
    npc_overs_brief_res_a_3: You won't regret it, friend! I've marked you a site that

      if you can't secure them!
    npc_overs_brief_ret_lang_3: I still have those coordinates, friend, if you have
      the time and inclination to investigate?
    npc_overs_brief_ret_desc_3: |-
      My Overseer does not like to take no for an answer. However, I struggle to disagree with their conclusions. More storage would indeed be very useful.

      The Overseer claims I will find data for a <TECHNOLOGY>Storage Container<> blueprint in a nearby structure.
    npc_overs_wait_lang_3: No need to delay, friend! The data is waiting, all you
      have to do is seize it!
    npc_overs_wait_desc_3: The Overseer talks sense, as they always do. There is little
      reason to wait here when there is so much to do out there in the world.
    npc_overs_wait_opt_a_3: Agree to hurry
    npc_overs_wait_opt_b_3: Shrug
    npc_overs_wait_res_a_3: The Overseer bids me farewell, happy to see me busy about
      my task.
    npc_overs_wait_res_b_3: The Overseer seems disquieted by my apathy. But I am the
      master of this base, not them.
    npc_overs_comp_lang_3: You are back! I'm so glad, friend! I will extract the <TECHNOLOGY>storage
      blueprint<> as soon as I have the data.
    npc_overs_comp_desc_3: It is good to see the Gek is so invested in the success
      of our home. They are clearly happy to see me, energised for the task at hand.
    npc_overs_comp_opt_a_3: Give data
    npc_overs_comp_opt_b_3: Decline
    npc_overs_comp_res_a_3: Here is your <TECHNOLOGY>blueprint<>, as promised. A trivial
      task, their code was just sitting there to be manipulated!
    npc_overs_comp_res_b_3: We have the data, and are safe enough in our little home.
      There is no need to hurry.
    npc_overs_wait_for_sci_lang: |-
      Now then...
      Do you think, friend, that we should put that <TECHNOLOGY>science terminal<> to use? Fill our home with the clicks and lights of the Korvax? It would be so lovely.
    npc_overs_wait_for_sci_desc: The Overseer feels the base would benefit from a
      Korvax Scientist. They would like to see good use made of the blueprint they
      worked so hard on.
    npc_overs_wait_for_sci_opt_a: Agree
    npc_overs_wait_for_sci_opt_b: Disagree
    npc_overs_wait_for_sci_res_a: I'm so glad we had this chat, friend!

      I will still be here for you!
    npc_overs_brief_main_lang_4: |-
      Things are going well, friend. But it will not be long before violence follows us here. It is inevitable.
      If I had some <COMMODITY>Microprocessors<>, I could steal a march on fate. Yes! I would design a <TECHNOLOGY>Weapons Terminal<> suitable for a Vy'keen armorer.
    npc_overs_brief_main_desc_4: The Overseer asks me for <COMMODITY>Microprocessors<>
      in order to design a <TECHNOLOGY>Weapons Terminal<>. The Scientist should be
      able to assist with the task.
    npc_overs_brief_opt_a_4: Accept
    npc_overs_brief_opt_b_4: Decline
    npc_overs_brief_res_a_4: "%NAME% has been helpful so far, and I have no reason
      to distrust them. I shall find them the <COMMODITY>microprocessors<> they need."
    npc_overs_brief_res_b_4: I am in no hurry to bring war to our little sanctuary.
    npc_overs_brief_ret_lang_4: Recruit a Vy’keen, friend, and learn from their species!
      Remember the nature of war, dwell on the fate of the warrior!
    npc_overs_brief_ret_desc_4: |-
      %NAME% is convinced our home would benefit from the addition of a Vy'keen armorer. Perhaps they are right. What harm could it do, to be prepared to defend ourselves?

      The Overseer asks me for some <COMMODITY>Microprocessors<> in order to design a <TECHNOLOGY>Weapons Terminal<>. The Scientist should be able to assist with the task.
    npc_overs_wait_lang_4: |-
      Have you spent time among the Vy'keen? You could learn from their pointless struggle, their inane war against the Sentinels. It is the fate of all to destroy their worlds, Traveler.
      Even you.
    npc_overs_wait_desc_4: |-
      This latest pronouncement troubles me. I have no lust to destroy worlds; any weapons I have built have been for my own protection.

      Haven't they?
    npc_overs_wait_opt_a_4: Ask about the Vy'keen
    npc_overs_wait_opt_b_4: Ask about my fate
    npc_overs_wait_res_a_4: You know all about the Vy'keen, Traveler! Do you not remember?
      Think!
    npc_overs_wait_res_b_4: The Overseer laughs at my question, and then... there's
      something, some notion I am unable to quite wrap my head around, on the verge
      of my comprehension and yet unreachable.
    npc_overs_comp_lang_4: I trust our new Korvax friend was helpful? They are merely
      the start of our merry band! Are you ready to take the next step?
    npc_overs_comp_desc_4: The Overseer asks for the <COMMODITY>microprocessors<>

    npc_overs_comp_res_b_4: You cannot ignore fate, friend! It comes for us all, in
      the end.
    npc_overs_brief_main_lang_5: |-
      Now... Imagine this, friend. A lifeform displeases you. You punish it, reward it, reshape it. In time, it would do anything you wanted.
      So it is with the Sentinels and their attacks. But no more - now we shall train the trainers.
    npc_overs_brief_main_desc_5: The Overseer requires me to kill Sentinels and bring
      back their <SPECIAL>Pugneum<>.
    npc_overs_brief_opt_a_5: Accept
    npc_overs_brief_opt_b_5: Decline
    npc_overs_brief_res_a_5: The Sentinels have harried me the length of my journey.
      We shall be free of their constant harassment!
    npc_overs_brief_res_b_5: There is something different about the Overseer's request.
      Usually their plan is clear, the benefit obvious. I must consider this further
      before I accept.
    npc_overs_brief_ret_lang_5: Have you considered the experiment further, friend?
      Do you see the glorious logic of it? We have the power to shape them, as they
      have tried to shape us!
    npc_overs_brief_ret_desc_5: The Overseer requires me to kill Sentinels and bring
      back their <SPECIAL>Pugneum<>.
    npc_overs_wait_lang_5: Yes, friend? Can I help?
    npc_overs_wait_desc_5: |-
      Is it murder to destroy these drones and loot their components? I am master of these worlds, not them. They deserve pain, they deserve to feel that as I – as I –

      I look at the Gek and smell a strange smell. I wonder, not for the first time, if it is somehow affecting my thoughts. I dismiss the notion. The Gek is my friend, after all.
    npc_overs_wait_opt_a_5: Seek reassurance
    npc_overs_wait_opt_b_5: Leave quietly
    npc_overs_wait_res_a_5: It is not aggression, friend. It is retribution for their
      unprovoked attacks!
    npc_overs_wait_res_b_5: What is the Overseer's purpose? Is it truly to shape the
      Sentinels? Or do they have someone else in mind?
    npc_overs_comp_lang_5: Do you have it, friend? Their flesh, their <SPECIAL>Pugneum<>?
    npc_overs_comp_desc_5: The Overseer, in something of a state of excitement, asks
      me for the <SPECIAL>pugneum<> I have gathered.
    npc_overs_comp_opt_a_5: Give pugneum
    npc_overs_comp_opt_b_5: Decline
    npc_overs_comp_res_a_5: "%NAME% presents me with a reward, as I knew they would."
    npc_overs_comp_res_b_5: Oh! Why do you permit the Sentinels to roam free while
      I, your friend, sit here starving?
    npc_overs_wait_for_arm_lang: |-
      Friend, there is another matter... I gave you the means to create a <TECHNOLOGY>Weapons Terminal<>, did I not? Yet I see no Vy'keen in attendance.
      Does my help mean so little to you that you would tarry so? You must recruit an Armorer before we can proceed.
    npc_overs_wait_for_arm_desc: The Overseer requires me to build a <TECHNOLOGY>Weapons
      Terminal<> and recruit a Vy'keen Armorer for my base.
    npc_overs_wait_for_arm_opt_a: Accept
    npc_overs_wait_for_arm_opt_b: Refuse
    npc_overs_wait_for_arm_res_a: Splendid! I do enjoy our Vy'keen friends. We shall
      all live in harmony, I think.
    npc_overs_wait_for_arm_res_b: You'll come around, in time... but do not take too
      long. My patience only extends so far.
    npc_overs_brief_main_lang_6: Things are aligning. We are ready now for a Gek farmer
      to join us. Indeed, I have already prepared their contract. All you need to
      do is gather the <SPECIAL>solanium<> required to finalise their workstation.
    npc_overs_brief_main_desc_6: |-
      %NAME% grows in confidence, and seeks again to expand my home. I find it hard to disagree with them, for a farmer would open up a world of possibilities.

      The Overseer needs <SPECIAL>solanium<> to complete the <TECHNOLOGY>Agricultural Terminal<> plans. Solanium grows on scorched planets and requires <TECHNOLOGY>Haz-Mat Gauntlets<> to harvest.
    npc_overs_brief_opt_a_6: Accept
    npc_overs_brief_opt_b_6: Decline
    npc_overs_brief_res_a_6: Solanium is not easy to acquire in the wild, but this
      only proves the value of recruiting a farmer.
    npc_overs_brief_res_b_6: Though a farm sounds appealing, there is something about
      this insistent Gek that makes me uneasy.
    npc_overs_brief_ret_lang_6: Remember, friend, the farmer is ready. We should not
      delay their arrival. This is how things should be.
    npc_overs_brief_ret_desc_6: The Overseer needs <SPECIAL>solanium<> to complete
      the <TECHNOLOGY>Agricultural Terminal<> plans. Solanium grows on scorched planets
      and requires <TECHNOLOGY>Haz-Mat Gauntlets<> to harvest.
    npc_overs_wait_lang_6: In this cycle, a humble farmer. In others, there is no
      limit to their destruction. But there is no need to worry. That which you cannot
      see, does not happen.
    npc_overs_wait_desc_6: The Overseer's description of this potential farmer is
      alarming to say the least. Are they trying to upset me, or is this some secret,
      released only by chance?
    npc_overs_wait_opt_a_6: Ask about the farmer
    npc_overs_wait_opt_b_6: Do not inquire
    npc_overs_wait_res_a_6: Do not worry, friend. We would all be very different in
      the wrong conditions. Such is the nature of things!
    npc_overs_wait_res_b_6: The Overseer watches me as I leave. I find it hard to
      understand what they are really thinking.
    npc_overs_comp_lang_6: It is good to see you, friend. I trust the Vy'keen's technology
      kept you safe?
    npc_overs_comp_desc_6: I have the <SPECIAL>solanium<> required to finish the plans
      for the farmer's workstation. It will be interesting to see what effect a second
      Gek will have on my Overseer. I cannot imagine they have spent much time conversing
      with the Scientist or the Armorer.
    npc_overs_comp_opt_a_6: Give solanium
    npc_overs_comp_opt_b_6: Decline
    npc_overs_comp_res_a_6: Ah, to farm! We shall exploit the earth, free at last
      from the Sentinels, and practise the glory of trade!
    npc_overs_comp_res_b_6: What is the matter? Do you not want to see another Gek
      in your home? Am I already too many?
    npc_overs_brief_main_lang_7: |-
      Once you have secured our farmer, you will want to trade unhindered! To profit from our glorious harvest without being dragged to and fro!
      Never fear, friend, for I shall make it so. All I require are a few <TECHNOLOGY>circuit boards<> to finish the plans for a trade terminal of our own.
    npc_overs_brief_main_desc_7: The Overseer requests <TECHNOLOGY>Circuit Boards<>
      in order to create a <TECHNOLOGY>Galactic Trade Terminal<> blueprint. The Korvax
      Scientist should be able to provide the necessary parts.
    npc_overs_brief_opt_a_7: Accept
    npc_overs_brief_opt_b_7: Decline
    npc_overs_brief_res_a_7: I do not have the zeal for trade that seems to seize
      the Gek. Nonetheless, it would be convenient to tap into the galactic market
      from right here in my home.
    npc_overs_brief_res_b_7: Mercantile obsession is fine for the Gek, but this base
      is an island of my own making. I am not ready to bring the eye of the market
      here, blinking upon my walls, always pricing my time.
    npc_overs_brief_ret_lang_7: Come, friend! A few circuits are a small price to
      pay for unfettered access to the glory of trade!
    npc_overs_brief_ret_desc_7: The Overseer requests <TECHNOLOGY>Circuit Boards<>
      in order to create an <TECHNOLOGY>Galactic Trade Terminal<> blueprint. The Korvax
      Scientist should be able to provide the necessary parts.
    npc_overs_wait_lang_7: Factories infest this place, worlds upon worlds spitting
      out resources for no purpose, yet you are attacked by Sentinels for obliterating
      a single rock? It is outrageous. It makes me sick.
    npc_overs_wait_desc_7: |-
      The Overseer is right. I am attacked by Sentinels for mining small quantities of resources when factory complexes operate with impunity.
      Why? Why do they ignore such greed while I must fight for mere survival?
    npc_overs_wait_opt_a_7: Agree this is unjust
    npc_overs_wait_opt_b_7: Shrug in acceptance
    npc_overs_wait_res_a_7: It is good to see your anger! Ask yourself, why do the
      Sentinels get to choose who suffers? Who gave them this power?
    npc_overs_wait_res_b_7: Friend! Such blithe indifference! This apathy is not acceptable.
      Think of all the others you doom by inaction.
    npc_overs_comp_lang_7: I trust our Scientist was able to meet your needs, friend?
      They have the circuits we demand?
    npc_overs_comp_desc_7: |-
      As I approached the Overseer, I was almost certain I heard them talking to themselves, spitting out words and phrases in a tongue I recognise but do not understand. But seconds later, there is no trace of the venom I thought I heard. I must be mistaken.

      %NAME% asks me for the <TECHNOLOGY>circuit boards<>.
    npc_overs_comp_opt_a_7: Give circuits
    npc_overs_comp_opt_b_7: Decline
    npc_overs_comp_res_a_7: The Overseer is strange, but no more so than any of the
      other beings I have encountered. Indeed, they have been more helpful than most.
      I hand over the circuits and receive my reward.
    npc_overs_comp_res_b_7: Why do you delay, friend? No matter, I am sure there is
      a reason. You have a plan, there is always reason, I do not doubt it.
    npc_overs_brief_main_lang_8: Ah, friend, you will be so happy with %NAME%! I have
      drawn up plans for some <TECHNOLOGY>Starship Technology<>! But I cannot yet
      sync my design with your ship. I shall need a <SPECIAL>Gravitino Ball<> to perfect
      my device.
    npc_overs_brief_main_desc_8: |-
      The Overseer predicted I would be pleased, and once again they are correct. They have been ceaseless in their efforts to improve my lot.
      A <SPECIAL>Gravitino Ball<> is required to finish their promised <TECHNOLOGY>Starship Technology<>. The farmer may be able to help acquire one.
    npc_overs_brief_opt_a_8: Accept
    npc_overs_brief_opt_b_8: Decline
    npc_overs_brief_res_a_8: You will not regret it, friend! It is good we work so
      well together.
    npc_overs_brief_res_b_8: So be it. Cooperation is not for everyone. I shall still
      be here when you change your mind.
    npc_overs_brief_ret_lang_8: Only you can leave, friend, so you should do so with
      ease and freedom!
    npc_overs_brief_ret_desc_8: |-
      The Overseer makes a point of noting my freedom to come and go as I wish, even as they offer me another improvement to my base.
      %NAME% offers me a specially made piece of <TECHNOLOGY>Starship Technology<>, but a <SPECIAL>Gravitino Ball<> is required to finish them. The farmer may be able to help.
    npc_overs_wait_lang_8: |-
      You may leave, but do not be deceived. We are all prisoners, even you.
      If you abandon me, you'll find another Gek with a different face but the same soul, the same words... We are paired to you throughout time and memory, your servants, your teachers!
    npc_overs_wait_desc_8: |-
      %NAME% suggests that if I were to dismiss them from my service, I would find another just like them, as if nothing at all had happened. They claim I am a prisoner.

      I know only that I must trust the Overseer. I know it in my heart.
    npc_overs_wait_opt_a_8: Apologise
    npc_overs_wait_opt_b_8: Insist you are free
    npc_overs_wait_res_a_8: Do not apologise, friend. You did not choose this any
      more than we did.
    npc_overs_wait_res_b_8: You will believe what you will believe, friend. Such is
      the nature of things.
    npc_overs_comp_lang_8: Did you enjoy your adventure, friend? Your expedition to
      find our orb? I have waited for you faithfully.
    npc_overs_comp_desc_8: |-
      There is something about the way %NAME% speaks that, for all their kind words, suggests a resentment saved only for the deepest of enemies.

      But they would not have come to work here if we were enemies. Of course not. We are friends.

      The Overseer asks for the <SPECIAL>Gravitino Ball<> so they can finish the <TECHNOLOGY>starship technology<> design.
    npc_overs_comp_opt_a_8: Give Gravitino Ball
    npc_overs_comp_opt_b_8: Decline
    npc_overs_comp_res_a_8: As ever, I am so grateful for your assistance. Friend.
    npc_overs_comp_res_b_8: As you wish. You will give me that orb eventually, you
      know.
    npc_overs_brief_main_lang_9: Have you ever wondered what happens after death,
      between expiration and rebirth? Meditate upon annihilation. Harvest <SPECIAL>Mordite<>
      from the dead. It is the only way to escape.
    npc_overs_brief_main_desc_9: |-
      Since the Overseer arrived, I have had a recurring dream, a nightmare that feels like a memory. Flesh merged with metal; a world of glass that blinks.

      A planet with green skies and an obsidian moon, a dream where I see my grave... As I snap back to reality, there is a moment before I can shake the image, that wound on the world lingering before my eyes.

      The Overseer asks me to harvest <SPECIAL>Mordite<>, a material found in the bodies of slain creatures.
    npc_overs_brief_opt_a_9: Accept
    npc_overs_brief_opt_b_9: Decline
    npc_overs_brief_res_a_9: The Overseer has served me well. Perhaps their task will
      free my mind from these lingering nightmares.
    npc_overs_brief_res_b_9: Perhaps this is not the time to meditate upon annihilation.
    npc_overs_brief_ret_lang_9: I know you see it too, friend. The crimson eye. It
      always finds you.
    npc_overs_brief_ret_desc_9: |-
      Mordite is a strange material, a constant in an ever-changing universe. Perhaps %NAME% is right. Perhaps it does offer a clue.
      The Overseer asks me to harvest <SPECIAL>Mordite<>, a material found in the bodies of slain creatures.
    npc_overs_wait_lang_9: Have you any memories of the blink between cycles, the
      brief infinity between life and rebirth? I doubt it, friend! Few do.
    npc_overs_wait_desc_9: I do not know what to make of %NAME%'s question. They know
      my answer already, I feel, and are not interested in what I have to say.
    npc_overs_wait_opt_a_9: Return the question
    npc_overs_wait_opt_b_9: Ignore them
    npc_overs_wait_res_a_9: The Overseer laughs, their beak clicking as it opens and
      shuts.
    npc_overs_wait_res_b_9: The Overseer studies me, a look of intense concentration
      upon their face. I should leave them be.
    npc_overs_comp_lang_9: I can see the change in you, friend. You have completed
      your task, and I have seen the world as you see it.
    npc_overs_comp_desc_9: I do not entirely understand what I have done for the Overseer,
      but they seem once again ready to reward me for my actions.
    npc_overs_comp_opt_a_9: Give mordite
    npc_overs_comp_opt_b_9: Decline
    npc_overs_comp_res_a_9: Here. Take these schematics. May the things you build
      always remind you of those you killed to construct them.
    npc_overs_comp_res_b_9: Be careful, friend. Holding all that death for too long...
      who knows what it will do to you.
    npc_overs_terminal_lang_3: User identified. Terminal active. Accessing schematics.
    npc_overs_terminal_desc_3: |-
      The place the Overseer has led me to has long since fallen into disrepair. Its panels are buried beneath the same oily, pulsating fauna that I have seen before in long-abandoned buildings.

      The air is fetid and damp. I power-up the terminal with little hope of success, but to my surprise, it buzzes noisily and springs to life.
    npc_overs_terminal_opt_a: Analyse schematics
    npc_overs_terminal_res_a: My Overseer's intuition has served me well so far. I
      shall have to trust that these schematics contain the required data.
    npc_overs_terminal_wait_lang_3: TERMINAL BREACHED // SECURITY MEASURES ACTIVATED
      // USER LOGGED ... // DATA WIPED
    npc_overs_terminal_wait_desc_3: The terminal has not responded positively to my
      probing. I have the data I need, but there seems little hope of gathering any
      more information.
    npc_overs_terminal_wait_opt_a: Test input panel
    npc_overs_terminal_wait_res_a: The machine remains unresponsive.
    npc_overs_final_lang: |-
      I asked, friend, but you complied. Does that make you guilty? Does that mark your hands with sin? Friend! Interloper! Traveler! What are you?
      Don't you see it? Everything in these worlds is built for you. The history of blood, of malice; all of it happened so that you might find out about it one day, a backdrop for your journey!
    npc_overs_final_desc: |-
      And there’s that strange scent in the air again, a pheromone issuing forth... This time I live the memories of the Overseer as if they are my own. I see their life swept away upon our first meeting, approaching them in a strange building with my weapon raised...

      I am filled with a terrible certainty that for this Gek, millennia have passed since this event. But that is not possible. I never went to such a building. These things never happened.
    npc_overs_loop_lang: |-
      Leave me. You'll never understand. That day I stared into the world of glass and saw the space between things, the dark heart of reality.
      I will wait out my days here, until I am reborn again. Until we repeat all this, in a world beyond these worlds... As I repeat myself, even now!
    npc_overs_loop_desc: |-
      The Overseer asks me to leave. They tell me they have nothing more to say. They are clearly addled, clearly confused. This base is a happy place. This world is mine. Of that I am certain.

      The ravings of a single Gek won't change that.

      The Overseer tells me that their contract is complete.
    npc_overs_loop_opt_a: Touch the Overseer gently
    npc_overs_loop_opt_b: Leave the Overseer be
    npc_overs_loop_res_a: The Gek does not react to my touch, and I do not let it
      linger.
    npc_overs_loop_res_b: Their presence is unnerving, but I feel it better that the
      Overseer remains here, where I can see them.
    npc_arms_brief_main_lang_1: "Your Gek servant told me you were coming, interloper.
      It is an honor to meet one whose bloodlust exceeds even my own! Grah! We shall

      begins! Come, let us inhale the requisite Grahgrah!"
    npc_arms_brief_main_desc_1: |-
      The Vy'keen is old. It is not their skin or appearance that suggests this; these beings are too alien, too unusual for me to make a judgement on that basis.

      No, it is the way they hold themselves, the way they speak. They do not posture; when they smile at me and tell me it is an honor for us to meet, I believe them.

      change your mind. I thirst for the hunt!

      greater decision than allying with me!

      my new <TECHNOLOGY>Weapons Terminal<>."
    npc_arms_wait_lang_1: |-
      In my youth, I was a coward, infamous amongst my clan. I could not bring myself to shoot a simple Gek, let alone a fearsome Sentinel drone!
      But times change. We lose our weakness. I hope you will shed yours...
    npc_arms_wait_opt_a_1: Leave
    npc_arms_wait_res_a_1: Grah! I shall see you soon, interloper!
    npc_arms_comp_lang_1: |-
      These facilities are glorious, but know that we Vy'keen exterminate worlds that show even the merest hint of weapons production... Consider yourself lucky that I am your friend! Grahahah!
      Violence must be ended; this is the way of Dryn'dargh; this is the way of Hirk. When murder is gone, the last weapon fired will be at the Vy'keen ourselves, having served our holy purpose.
    npc_arms_comp_desc_1: As a gesture of peace, the Armorer offers me a piece of
      <TECHNOLOGY>Exosuit Technology<>. They are keen to demonstrate they are more
      than a simple warrior.
    npc_arms_comp_opt_a_1: Accept the gift

    npc_arms_brief_main_lang_2: |-
      Vy'keen High Command would not permit me to reside here and ignore my purpose, interloper.
      I have discovered a weapons factory nearby, and to sabotage it would demonstrate our worth. While you are there, perhaps you may also learn something useful for yourself...
    npc_arms_brief_main_desc_2: |-
      I learn that the Vy'keen believe that no other species should be able to hold weapons; that after the atrocities committed by the Gek, only the Vy'keen should be trusted with arms.

      The Armorer gives me the location of a nearby weapons factory, claiming it is operating illegally. If I go there and shut down production, I may be able to extract a valuable blueprint.
    npc_arms_brief_opt_a_2: Accept
    npc_arms_brief_opt_b_2: Decline
    npc_arms_brief_res_a_2: Grah! Go with honor, but be wary. The eye of the Sentinels
      will be upon the facility.
    npc_arms_brief_res_b_2: Do not tarry long. I await your compliance, interloper!
    npc_arms_brief_ret_lang_2: Grah, interloper! Each second we delay is another crate
      of weapons produced, another cycle of violence created. We must destroy that
      factory!
    npc_arms_brief_ret_desc_2: The Armorer gives me the location of a nearby weapons
      factory, claiming it is operating illegally. If I go there and shut down production,
      I may be able to extract a valuable blueprint.
    npc_arms_wait_lang_2: Be careful, interloper. The Sentinels will always try to
      stop us. Who can say what awaits you at the factory?
    npc_arms_wait_desc_2: |-
      The Vy'keen have been warring with the Sentinels for centuries, though %NAME% tells me that they do not hate the drones. They are a worthy opponent, they say, in many senses the epitome of Vy'keen values.
      Justice, preservation, strength. Everything, except that which matters most: passion, honor, and fraternity... As the Armorer speaks, they grow sad and quiet in their speech, occasionally breaking into a cough.
    npc_arms_wait_opt_a_2: Bow and leave
    npc_arms_wait_opt_b_2: Leave
    npc_arms_wait_res_a_2: "%NAME% returns my bow with a nod of respect."
    npc_arms_wait_res_b_2: The warrior stares at me, silent.

    npc_arms_comp_res_a_2: |-
      Excellent work, interloper! Grah! Did you obtain any technology of our own? Here, I will decrypt it for you.

      Ships<> orbiting this world, asking me to go and <SPECIAL>fight them<>.

      piracy!
    npc_arms_brief_main_lang_4: "Interloper, there is both good and bad news. Some
      of the pirates appear to have fled your wrath! But this merely delays their

      are flowers that grow only where many drones have fallen in combat. Oh, to see
      such sights.

      They approach... but before the final fight, I have another task for you. I need to be strong to serve you. There is a substance, an offering freely given by the young to their elders, that may yet restore me.
      I myself spent years enmeshed within the harvest circuits, my organs sacrificing their enzymes for the fleet. I was glad to do so. But we need not repeat such torment today. Enzyme remnants found on <TRADEABLE>Vy'keen Daggers<> should be enough to heal me now.

      Whatever sacrifice %NAME% made for others, they do not appear to have reaped the same benefits in their old age. The Vy'keen's body is scarred, their speech laboured. I cannot imagine they will survive another year.

      die? Graaah!

      cruelty is this?

      provided them with renewed purpose. Of this I am glad. \n\nBut placing my world

      the base, apologising profusely, telling me that the living deserve service
      more than the dead, that I especially am worthy of their aid. \n\nThe Armorer
      rewards me with a token of my great victory."

      raw materials to create an endless parade of beauty.
    npc_arms_depot_desc_1: The terminal stands ready to receive data input. I could
      trigger a distress event, broadcasting a signal to summon the Sentinels to this

      The Korvax appears to have no memory of our previous encounters. I do not know if they feel reconnected with the Convergence, or if they simply do not recall what they should feel like.

      I should visit this Observatory for them, and see if the structural analysis they enjoy will prompt a memory.
    npc_sci_wait_lang_4: You bring great honor to the Korvax, Traveler! Eheu!
    npc_sci_wait_opt_a_4: Show respect
    npc_sci_wait_opt_b_4: Dismiss
    npc_sci_wait_res_a_4: Eheu! Eheu! Eheu!
    npc_sci_wait_res_b_4: The Korvax does not respond verbally, but their lights flash
      as they struggle to contain their disappointment.
    npc_sci_comp_lang_4: Traveler! While you have been absent, Korvax has detected
      anomalies. I feel... alone. Perhaps the data will have answer?
    npc_sci_comp_opt_a_4: Give data
    npc_sci_comp_opt_b_4: Decline
    npc_sci_comp_res_a_4: This data contains no answers, Traveler. Merely these blueprints,
      for  <COMMODITY>Living Glass<> and a <TECHNOLOGY>Beacon<>.
    npc_sci_comp_res_b_4: The data is yours to give, Traveler. But please, Korvax
      must complete promise of aid!
    npc_sci_brief_main_lang_5: The Convergence is absent, Traveler. We - I - can feel
      myself slipping further. Perhaps that <TECHNOLOGY>Beacon<> may be of some use?
      Construct one, and the Convergence may find me again!
    npc_sci_brief_main_desc_5: Where the transmission tower failed, perhaps a <TECHNOLOGY>Beacon<>
      will succeed? The chance seems slim, but it is worth trying.
    npc_sci_brief_opt_a_5: Accept
    npc_sci_brief_opt_b_5: Decline
    npc_sci_brief_res_a_5: Korvax is grateful, Traveler! I shall also work on my own
      solution while you investigate the <TECHNOLOGY>Beacon<>.
    npc_sci_brief_res_b_5: The words the transmitter spoke were not those of an accidental
      disconnection. I should be cautious of giving my Scientist false hope.
    npc_sci_brief_ret_lang_5: The Convergence is still out there, Traveler, I am sure
      of it. We only need to re-establish a connection. They will not have abandoned
      me!
    npc_sci_brief_ret_desc_5: Where the transmission tower failed, perhaps a <TECHNOLOGY>Beacon<>
      will succeed? It is not such a high cost, when it clearly means so much to %NAME%.
    npc_sci_wait_lang_5: Korvax can only appeal to your understanding of loneliness,
      Traveler. It already aches, to be separated from myself.
    npc_sci_wait_desc_5: I wonder how the Korvax perceives time, now that they are
      shorn from the Convergence? They were connected to so many lives, and now they
      have only themselves.
    npc_sci_wait_opt_a_5: Promise to hurry
    npc_sci_wait_opt_b_5: Promise nothing
    npc_sci_wait_res_a_5: The Korvax nods, nervous appreciative.
    npc_sci_wait_res_b_5: Perhaps I truly am alone.
    npc_sci_comp_lang_5: Is the <TECHNOLOGY>Beacon<> constructed, Traveler?
    npc_sci_comp_opt_a_5: Confirm
    npc_sci_comp_opt_b_5: Wait
    npc_sci_comp_res_a_5: We shall wait, it may take time for the Convergence to find
      me. My own research proved fruitless. It yielded only blueprints.
    npc_sci_comp_res_b_5: Eheu! Traveler, there may only be a small window for reconnection!
    npc_sci_brief_main_lang_6: |-
      Those <TECHNOLOGY>atmosphere harvester<> and <TECHNOLOGY>mining unit<> plans prompted a thought. What if they could be friends for the Beacon? What if they could make their own Convergence?
      They shall be my children, Traveler!
      I have transmitted a crafted intelligence to the Beacon, so that they might live and connect as the Korvax do. But it cannot see the world - bring me <SPECIAL>scan data<>, so that I might teach it!

      %NAME%'s plan seems desperate, but it does seem to have genuinely made them happier, or at least less anxious about their separation.

      yourself.
    npc_sci_brief_ret_desc_6: |-
      The Scientist says nothing, but looks at me with renewed hope. Perhaps I should indulge %NAME%'s request. At the very least, it may yield more blueprints.
      The Korvax asks me to scan creatures to feed its newly created intelligence.
    npc_sci_wait_lang_6: Isn't it wonderful Traveler? To be an 'us' again! Eheu!

    npc_sci_wait_opt_b_6: Express doubts
    npc_sci_wait_res_a_6: |-
      I use the term 'artificial', but %NAME% corrects me. They tell me that all intelligence is artificial, all bodies mere shells for something greater.
      The Korvax body is merely a shell, a carapace for their souls: a networked core of many intelligences.
    npc_sci_wait_res_b_6: "%NAME% looks at me sharply, their lights flashing in a
      strange sequence. This must mean something, but I can only assume I am not the
      intended audience."
    npc_sci_comp_lang_6: Do you have the data, Traveler? My child cannot see the world
      as you see it. To share your scans will be to share your consciousness with
      them. It is a tremendous gift.

      hope it makes you happy.
    npc_sci_comp_res_b_6: Traveler, we understand your kind do not experience the
      Convergence. But do not be afraid to take the first step towards a higher consciousness.
    npc_sci_brief_main_lang_7: "Traveler, this data has raised a concern. As a beacon,
      my child could receive signals from unknown sources all across the galaxy.\nI

      Traveler, I had a nightmare a few days ago. This is something we share, is it not?
      In my dream, I cried out for the Convergence, but no response came. I cried out for you, but you only laughed. And finally, I cried out for my Beacon. Nothing answered. Do you understand what this means?
    npc_sci_wait_opt_a_7: It means nothing
    npc_sci_wait_opt_b_7: It means we are alone
    npc_sci_wait_res_a_7: |-
      I reassure the Scientist. All beings dream, but the images are random.
      If they reflect anything, they reflect our fears. They do not reflect reality. This appears to calm them, though I suspect some other worry is at work.
    npc_sci_wait_res_b_7: I tell the Scientist their dream reflects their inner state,
      that their loneliness is filling their subconscious, spilling out into their
      dreams. This does not serve to make them happy.
    npc_sci_comp_lang_7: Have you found the <COMMODITY>Ion Batteries<>, Traveler?
    npc_sci_comp_desc_7: The Korvax looks anxious. Their disconnection from the Convergence,
      and their anxiety for their child, is taking its toll. Perhaps the batteries
      will help them settle.
    npc_sci_comp_opt_a_7: Give Ion Batteries

      Thank you, Traveler. It is good we can protect the little Beacon, but I fear it may not be enough. You should take a copy of the <COMMODITY>Poly-Fiber<> plans. They may be of some use to you.
      Now please, give me some time to educate my child.
    npc_sci_comp_res_b_7: What do you seek to accomplish, Traveler, that you would
      deny the Beacon this simple thing? Do you doubt its intelligence? Its reality?
    npc_sci_brief_wait_lang_8: You cannot hurry these things, Traveler. The bond between
      family components must be forged correctly.

    npc_sci_brief_main_desc_8: |-
      The Korvax has no memories of my last journey with their core.

      my people, I wonder... what if there isn't a way to fix things? What if death
      is inevitable? I must know the truth.

    npc_sci_brief_main_desc_9: |-
      The Scientist has once again been reset.
      But without a connection to the Convergence, I fear they are doomed to repeat this cycle forever, from the moment they met me in the space station until their collapse into loneliness.
      Perhaps if I can find them a <SPECIAL>Convergence Cube<>, they might be unified with the rest of the Korvax and escape.

      they will be fine.
    npc_sci_brief_ret_lang_9: Eheu! This terminal is awash with data samples, stranger!
      What a thrill!
    npc_sci_brief_ret_desc_9: Perhaps if I can find a <SPECIAL>Convergence Cube<>,
      I might reconnect the Scientist with the Convergence and restore their memories.
    npc_sci_wait_lang_9: So many opportunities for analysis! And this <TECHNOLOGY>Beacon<>
      is producing highly interesting results...

      been busy with analysis. However, the Convergence has been strangely quiet.
      I shall run additional tests...
    npc_sci_comp_lang_9: Stranger, I fear something unusual is occurring. Is this
      facility shielded in some way, so that signals are unable to escape?
    npc_sci_comp_desc_9: "%NAME% is once again becoming aware of their isolation.

      %NAME% possesses an obsession with those I have come to know as Sentinels. I have seen them looking over ancient scripts in the Vy'keen language, muttering various names – Obinqiul. Aeron. Atlas...

      Is this why their people pursue them? What secret have they discovered? What heresy have they committed?
    npc_exo_wait_opt_a_4: Ask about Atlas

      They decline to answer.

      The technician waits, fidgeting, nervous. I have not yet recovered the encrypted transmission they asked for. They stress that time is of the essence, urging me to proceed to the marked location at once.

      This will be the technician's final chance to hear from their family before they purge themselves of such attachments.
    npc_exo_wait_opt_a_5: Say you will go at once

      you retrieved the transmission? "
    npc_exo_comp_desc_5: They are frenzied at my approach, excited. Whatever this
      transmission might contain, whatever system it has been sent from, it would
      seem to matter a great deal to the Vy’keen.
    npc_exo_comp_opt_a_5: Say that you have
    npc_exo_comp_opt_b_5: Claim you have not
    npc_exo_comp_res_a_5: The technician tells me they are going to clean their mind
      to prepare for their holy task. Before they remove all other thoughts, they
      wish to know what happened to their family.
    npc_exo_comp_res_b_5: Please, Traveler... why do you torture me so? Retrieve the
      transmission at once!
    npc_exo_truth_lang: I must know, Traveler! Tell me what my consort said! Tell

    npc_exo_truth_desc: |-
      The technician was expecting to intercept a message from their consort and spawn, but instead... instead I discovered that their family had been killed, murdered by other Vy'keen in retaliation for their heresy.

      As they stand before me, expectant, nervous, I do not know whether to tell the truth.
    npc_exo_truth_opt_a: 'TRUTH: their family is dead'

      waiting, that not knowing... it fills me with a strange dread.
    npc_exo_wait_opt_a_6: Ask about Nal
    npc_exo_wait_opt_b_6: Ask about their plans
    npc_exo_wait_res_a_6: |-
      Traveler, know that my race were once more than just warriors; we were explorers, defenders of these worlds. Before the Sentinels, before Hirk and his great folly.
      Untold centuries ago, two Vy'keen approached the Great Monolith: Hirk and Nal, battle-brothers, sworn to deliver knowledge to the people! But in their jealousy, Hirk lied and murdered their brother Nal, claiming that they and they alone knew the righteous path.
      Nal's followers fled, killed almost to the last warrior. But there were those who never forgot. The Cult of Nal attempts to uncover the truth that was lost. We seek to restore the crimson truth, to heal the hearts of the ignorant!
      You participate in a great work, Traveler. History will remember your name.
    npc_exo_wait_res_b_6: |-
      There is a hidden secret at the heart of history, Traveler. A crime that has gone unpunished for far too long. The Vy'keen people have followed a false idol for centuries, debasing ourselves in endless slaughter.
      If I can prove that this false god, this 'Hirk', is nothing more than a murderer? We shall save souls!
    npc_exo_comp_lang_6: Have you built the <TECHNOLOGY>Mining Laser<>? I hope you
      enjoy working with Vy'keen technology. Nothing refines the design of a machine
      like using it in combat. Even if that combat is against the earth.
    npc_exo_comp_opt_a_6: Confirm it is built
    npc_exo_comp_opt_b_6: Say you are not ready

    npc_exo_wait_lang_7: Tell me, Traveler, of my previous incarnation. I wiped my

      curious. What was I like when you met me?
    npc_exo_wait_opt_a_7: Say they were more insulting
    npc_exo_wait_opt_b_7: Say they had a family
    npc_exo_wait_opt_c_7: Say they were the same

      The Vy'keen appears confused by this remark before dismissing me. They claim that all lifeforms have families, that this is not significant.
      But they grow quiet, not wishing to talk for a while. It is unclear what, if anything, they remember of their old life.
    npc_exo_wait_res_c_7: |-
      Unlikely. We are all defined by our memories, Traveler. I gave up part of who I was.
      What will you give up, I wonder?
    npc_exo_comp_lang_7: Have you brought the <EARTH>Magnetized Ferrite<>, Traveler?
      The signals are out there, I know they are. All you need is a <TECHNOLOGY>Signal

      Since we met, I have thought long and hard about your people, interloper. There are many so-called 'Travelers', scattered across our lore.
      Hirk said we were to aid your people when they made themselves known within our universe.
      Were they right? Did Nal tell them this? Or was it something else? What if Hirk lied about this, as Hirk lied about so many other things?
      There were those among my cult who believed entities such as yourself should be shot on sight. That you were enemies... I am glad that they were wrong.
    npc_exo_wait_opt_a_8: Ask why you must be aided
    npc_exo_wait_opt_b_8: Ask about the Travelers
    npc_exo_wait_res_a_8: Why must the thirsty drink? Why must sleepers rest? It is
      the command of the universe, Traveler. We do as we must.
    npc_exo_wait_res_b_8: |-
      There is little else to say other than what I have already told you.
      Scattered reports of Travelers throughout the years, ever progressing toward the center of the galaxy.
      Yet of late, your people have multiplied. There have been rumors of empires, hubs, alliances of Travelers from across the galaxy... I never thought to see one of you with my own eyes.
    npc_exo_comp_lang_8: Grah! The blueprints for your weapon upgrade are ready, interloper.
      Have you improved your scanning equipment yet?

      The technician gives me blueprints for weapon upgrades. But as they pass them to me, an alert begins to sound on their terminal.
      Their search is almost complete. A scan has found something...
    npc_exo_comp_res_b_8: Do so soon, interloper. The hour grows late.
    npc_exo_brief_main_lang_9: "That you chose this world, of all worlds, to make
      your home, out of infinite possibilities...\nI did not think it possible, but
      my scans have uncovered the truth: Nal themself visited this place. We shall

    npc_exo_brief_main_desc_9: |-
      The Vy'keen claims that this Nal, the namesake of their cult, once visited my planet. I cannot know if this is true.
      I walk through worlds of ruin and wonder at these peoples, at their obsession with their past, at the hatred that tore them asunder.
      I wonder what the future might hold, what secrets might echo out through the hub of creation.

      Your fear of the Nanite Clusters is unseemly, but understandable. Entire fleets have been lost forever due to contaminated samples.

    npc_exo_wait_desc_9: As I approach, the technician is deep in thought. They contemplate
      an elaborate web of maps, each displaying energy lines that criss-cross this
      world, converging upon a single endpoint...
    npc_exo_wait_opt_a_9: Ask about the lines
    npc_exo_wait_opt_b_9: Ask about the endpoint
    npc_exo_wait_res_a_9: They are leylines, Traveler. Energy streams that fuel the
      structures of many worlds. It is my belief that they will show me what I seek.
    npc_exo_wait_res_b_9: I believe this location to hold the answer to my quest...
      the final words of Nal the betrayed.

      The technician takes the Nanite Clusters. As they hold them, they appear to enter some strange trance. After a moment, it is done.

    npc_exo_brief_res_b_10: Grah! We do not have time for your uncertainty.

      before the testament vanishes...
    npc_exo_wait_lang_10: You know not how important this is, how many of my people
      would kill us where we stood for even mentioning Nal's name.
    npc_exo_wait_desc_10: The technician awaits the word of the Monolith, telling
      me that I must reach it quickly in order to activate its testament. They have

    npc_exo_comp_lang_10: |-
      I envy you, Traveler! To see the words of Nal themself! Grah!

      As for you, you are not as pathetic as I once believed. You are no longer interloper. You are one of us, now until the end of time itself, enthroned in the glory of the Colossus.

      The technician could have departed upon my discovery of the Monolith. Their heresy is now truth, and although there are those among the Vy'keen who will still pursue them, the Cultists of Nal will find themselves with new power in this galaxy.
      Yet still the technician has remained, promising to assist me as I assisted them, until such time as I no longer require their services.
    npc_exo_wait_opt_a_11: Thank them
    npc_exo_wait_opt_b_11: Leave
    npc_exo_wait_res_a_11: Grah! Do not thank! It is an honor to serve at your side.

      %NAME% begins a somewhat rambling diatribe on the state of intergalactic war and peace. It is only in the third hour that they reach the topic of <TRADEABLE>Gravitino Hosts<>.

      The nature of the relationship between Sentinels and the <TRADEABLE>Gravitino Hosts<> that grow on their worlds is unclear.

      Some theorize that the Hosts grow from the blood of fallen Sentinels, the drones acting as seeds for new life. Others say they are a sign of beauty, that the planet is worthy of Sentinel protection.

      %NAME% had a different theory. They suggested the Sentinels carried the pollen of the Hosts from world to world, the unique properties of both Host and Drone acting in symbiosis.

      %NAME% was apparently laughed out of their Botanical Society for this claim. They assure me they will never regret the pursuit of knowledge. Hours after they began, the talk is finished. They are delighted with themselves.

    npc_mission_cre_scan_1: The client requires a number of detailed biological surface
      scans. The data will be used to recreate lifelike holographic projections of
      each specimen, in order that others may enjoy observing them without threat
      to either viewer or creature.
    npc_mission_cre_scan_2: The client seeks high-quality lifeform scans. Detailed
      digital images are needed so that the client may test their skills at rendering
      a likeness of the creature in their chosen medium.
    npc_mission_cre_scan_3: The client requires a detailed biological survey. Their
      weaponized predator breeding programme has stalled, and new DNA samples are
      required to patch over existing weaknesses in hunting/stealth behaviors.
    npc_mission_cre_scan_4: The client requires urgent biological scan data. Species
      are wiped out every day, by climate disruption, war or industrial accident.
      While the client has no opinion on these events, they are concerned that this
      data loss renders their universal archive incomplete.
    npc_mission_cre_scan_5: The client sponsors a large gallery facility. Recent exhibitions
      have focused on abstract art, and visitor numbers have fallen. They seek realistic
      holographic projections of exciting or attractive animals in an effort to entice
      customers back to the gallery.
    npc_mission_cre_scan_6: |-
      The client runs a successful research facility. They have reached a stage in their career where they want to give something back to the scientific community.
      As a youngling, they were inspired by the majestic biological sights on their homeworld. They feel if they can supply holographic scans of similar creatures, they can bring the same sense of wonder to those unable to see such beasts in the flesh.
    npc_mission_cre_scan_7: The client is involved in an exozoology medical project,
      but it is inefficient to send veterinarians to every planet in the hope of finding
      sick animals. They are looking for data scans that sample animal populations.
      These can be tested for signs of disease and used to target their efforts most
      effectively.
    npc_mission_cre_scan_8: The client is fascinated by the process by which the planets
      are populated. Certain traits evolve time after time at different ends of the
      galaxy. They seek to understand if these parallel evolutions are natural and
      expected, strange coincidences, the result of some underlying pattern, or of
      outside meddling. They are building a database in which these traits and the
      environments that generated them can be evaluated, and seek enterprising explorers
      to help fill it.
    npc_mission_cre_scan_9: The client seeks explorers of discretion to aid them in
      a research project. Certain toxic substances may or may not have been leaked
      and/or intentionally vented into the atmospheres of nearby planets. Scans of
      local fauna will reveal if this potentially-toxic theoretical substance is having
      any long-term effects on the wildlife.
    npc_mission_cre_scan_10: The client is searching for new revenue streams for their
      agricultural business. They seek explorers to help them assess the suitability
      of local wildlife. Scans are needed to evaluate potential domestication, projected
      gestation time and feed cost, and the nutritional value of their harvested milk.
    npc_mission_tree_scan_1: The client supplies particular 'services' to high-value
      individuals across local space. From time-to-time, they require access to novel
      organic compounds, substances that are not part of any current toxicology screening.
      This is one of those times. Plant scans are the first port of call in such a
      search, and the client will reward any explorer who supplies them.
    npc_mission_tree_scan_2: The client is engaged in medical research. They seek
      to establish an open-access pharmacological database, so that medical knowledge
      can spread freely across the galaxy. Their philanthropy is well-funded, and
      so generous rewards are offered to any who supply their library with data.
    npc_mission_tree_scan_3: The client seeks to impress a colleague with a gift.
      The colleague in question is not physically present, so the present must be
      a virtual one. They will reward the explorer who supplies 3D holographic scans
      of handsome plantlife, ready to be beamed to their intended recipient.
    npc_mission_tree_scan_4: The client has achieved much, and by conventional metrics
      is a tremendous success. But they tire of material gain. Is not beauty a sufficient
      reward? Is not pure aesthetic joy more valuable than anything money can buy?
      They will provide generous rewards to those who scan and deliver examples of
      beautiful plant life for them to meditate upon.
    npc_mission_tree_scan_5: |-
      The client is a prominent crypto-entomologist. The galaxy is full of poorly documented lifeforms, and insects are among the least understood of all. They are tired of tiny invertebrates being ignored.
      The client does not expect untrained explorers to be able to locate samples in the field. However, scans of planetary flora often accidentally contain rich insect information. As such, the client seeks plant scans to help build their database.
    npc_mission_min_scan_1: The client is creating an artificial galaxy, a projection
      of reality that can generate all possible worlds. The underlying simulation
      is progressing well, but the client requires a vast number of props with which
      to fill their creation. They will pay handsomely for holographic-quality scans
      of rock formations that they can place into their model.
    npc_mission_min_scan_2: The client seeks to expand their lucrative mining operations.
      They work on a large scale, hoovering up colossal quantities of earth from orbital
      mining stations. The economics of such a procedure requires a minimum level
      of extractable mineral content, and they seek scans from the local area to assess
      which sites might prove suitable.
    npc_mission_min_scan_3: The client operates a mineral business. Their particular
      specialty is in the sourcing and refinement of electrically active minerals.
      This hazardous process is a key step in many high-tech supply chains, enabling
      the creation of the rechargeable shield cell, the photovoltaic panel, and the
      bioluminescent tattoo.
    npc_mission_min_scan_4: The client is concerned by the rampant collection and
      destruction of mineral formations. Far from being chunks of compressed soil
      and salt, the client believes these rocks to be the frozen bodies of once sentient
      beings. As such, to smash one and recycle it into engine parts would be a heinous
      crime. They seek scans of minerals as evidence for their cause.
    npc_mission_min_scan_5: The client takes great joy in the patterns that nature
      creates. They find the fact that beautiful structures emerge at random from
      a set of rules unconcerned with beauty to be a thing of great wonder. They want
      to share this awe with the world, and seek high quality mineral scans in order
      to do so.
    npc_mission_delivery_1: |-
      The client is seeking a trustworthy courier. They wish to honor a colleague with tribute, a celebration of their successful continued survival.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_2: |-
      The client is seeking a discrete delivery service. They wish to reassure the courier that the package is exactly what it seems and there is no need to mistrust the shipping manifest.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_3: |-
      The client is seeking resolution to a business deal. The other party has been negotiating hard, and the client hopes this package will remove any further impediment to their transaction. It is important the package is delivered only to the recipient.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_4: |-
      The client is conducting sensitive business. The package is a heartfelt thank you to certain parties. It is freely given, in the knowledge that any potential indiscretions have been, or will be, overlooked.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_5: |-
      The client simply wishes to pass on some goods to a colleague, nothing more. They have also supplied a message to the effect that the recipient has no need to worry, and that the goods are now untraceable.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_6: |-
      The client has an important and busy job so cannot be expected to take care of trivial domestic matters. It is a day for celebrating ones progenitors, and the custom is to give a gift to the one who spawned you. The client wishes this matter taken care of, so that they do not have to think about it.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_7: |-
      The client owes an emotional debt to a relation of theirs. They have forgotten to commemorate a date of particular importance. By way of apology, they have ordered an item of particular value to be shipped to the wronged party. Take care not to lose it in transport lest the client end up in further difficulty.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_8: |-
      The client has come across a strange item. While it appears ordinary, microbial scans revealed an alarming number of unknown spores. They need the item couriered to a biohazard specialist. Do not attempt to break the seal.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_9: |-
      The client wishes to send a message to an associate. There is no written message to accompany the item, and the item itself is of no great significance. However, they feel the delivery of the item to the associate's personal address will make their meaning particularly clear.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_10: |-
      The client wishes to declutter. They have accumulated a vast number of doodads that they now wish to dispose of. To destroy them would be wasteful, but to deposit them all in one location would potentially reveal too much personal information. As such, they have selected to disperse their items across both a large number of couriers and recipients.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_11: |-
      The client is engaging in a small-scale retail business. They purchase unwanted or underappreciated items and then unite them with buyers more in tune to their value. Their latest shipment is ready to be sent to the appreciative connoisseur who paid for it.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_12: |-
      The client has an entirely ordinary shipment and seeks a courier who will neither ask questions nor attract the attention of the authorities. The client wishes to reassure their potential courier that any animal noises heard coming from inside the packing crate are entirely in the courier's imagination.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_13: |-
      The client is part of a long and complex chain of transactions. To avoid leaving any potentially traceable records, the deal has been conducted free from the exchange of currency. This shipment represents their part of the payment to one of the other parties.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_14: |-
      The client is dispatching a regular shipment to one of their most loyal customers. The item is not particularly special, but it is important that the customer feels valued. To this end, they are eschewing bulk delivery methods and seek an experienced personal courier.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_15: |-
      The client dispatches a large number of items every day. Their business involves tight profit margins, and even the lightest of tax schemes could wipe out their gains. They find it generally more efficient to employ a discreet courier who just happens to deliver their item while on their ordinary, non-commercial business.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_16: |-
      The client is known to local pirates, and a bounty has been put on their head. They need to leave the system without being followed. They have embedded their tracking chip into this item, and require it ferried in the opposite direction to their escape.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_17: |-
      The galaxy is home to a large and varied web of regulations. Seemingly innocuous items in one system can be highly illegal elsewhere. Such differentiation creates commercial opportunities. The client wishes such an item delivered, with few questions asked and little attention drawn.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_18: |-
      The client wishes to secure a major new customer for their business. The customer wishes to sample the client's goods before committing to a bulk order. The client needs this sample delivered to the customer, and it needs to arrive in top condition.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_19: |-
      The client ships weekly packages to consumers who are unable or unwilling to shop for themselves. The consumer can then follow the included recipe to prepare themselves a delicious meal and/or robot servant. This shipment represents this week's order.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_delivery_20: |-
      The client has previously engaged a courier for this shipment, but they proved unable to complete the delivery. Both their Pulse Engine and cockpit canopy suffered a laser-induced mechanical failure. The client seeks a new bold new courier, able to out run any other mechanical failures that may be lurking outside the space station.

      The courier will be supplied with 1x Defense Chit, in case of pirate attack.
    npc_mission_cre_hunt_1: The client has a highly sophisticated palate, and hungers
      for the glide of mordite across their tongue. They seek a discreet hunter to
      prepare the feast. Leave the bodies where they fall, and the client will take
      care of the rest.
    npc_mission_cre_hunt_2: The client is in the zoological business. However, the
      ability of customers to simply wander into nature and view creatures without
      having to purchase a ticket is limiting their profits. Eliminate this surplus
      wildlife.
    npc_mission_cre_hunt_3: The client is concerned that creature overpopulation is
      harming local plant life. Delicate leaves and juicy, succulent stems are being
      wantonly trampled. They will reward any enterprising hunters who help thin the
      herd.
    npc_mission_cre_hunt_4: The client is worried that the free movement of creatures
      represents a serious microbial hazard. Rounding up large numbers of animals
      and washing them individually is highly impractical, so they seek hunters to
      eliminate both host and germ.
    npc_mission_cre_hunt_5: The client is tired of being humiliated by local wildlife.
      Every time they set foot upon a world, they can feel the mocking compound-eye
      stares burning into them, the passive-aggressive hoof stomping ringing in their
      ears. Teach these creatures a lesson.
    npc_mission_pred_hunt_1: The client is keen to spend time exploring local planets.
      However, they are worried about the presence of hostile wildlife. The observation
      of nature at work and play is easier to go about when nature is entirely vegetarian.
      Eliminate predatory creatures so that the client can move around safely.
    npc_mission_pred_hunt_2: The client is concerned about the recent trend of aggressive
      DNA collection and manipulation by companies keen to breed superpredators. Lobbying
      for greater regulation has proved futile, and so the client is preparing to
      take direct action. They will reward any explorer who exterminates predatory
      lifeforms, preventing research companies from acquiring the predator for themselves.
    npc_mission_pred_hunt_3: The client has recently spent time among the gentle herds
      of diplos. They have seen their plight first-hand, how these peaceful giants
      are hassled and harried by vicious predators. They can stand it no longer, and
      will reward any explorer who helps free the herbivorous from carnivorous tyranny.
    npc_mission_pred_hunt_4: The client seeks to engineer the next generation of superpredator.
      They will do so not by genetic manipulation, hemmed in by the limited imagination
      of the biologist. Instead, they will accelerate the evolutionary process and
      let nature refine its raw beasts into unrelenting carnivorous terror. To do
      so, they seek explorers to hunt and destroy predatory lifeforms. Each culled
      creature is a weakness removed from the genepool.
    npc_mission_pred_hunt_5: The client wishes to exploit the resources of local planets.
      However, Sentinel drones make such activity highly dangerous. They have observed
      that the drones do not harm those who kill carnivorous creatures. Therefore,
      they seek to curry favor with the Sentinels through the extermination of predatory
      creatures. With enough creatures destroyed, they reason they may offset the
      drone's wrath and gain the freedom to harvest minerals and flora.
    npc_mission_senti_1: The client is engaged in large-scale mining operations, and
      planetary Sentinel forces have responded in a hostile fashion. The maintenance
      and laser-damage repair costs are becoming substantial. The client wishes the
      Sentinels thinned and their profit margins restored.
    npc_mission_senti_2: The client is finding it difficult to pursue their chosen
      line of business while under constant surveillance by Sentinel forces. They
      seek a window of opportunity while the Sentinel force is occupied elsewhere.
    npc_mission_senti_3: The client has close friends who, through some unspecified
      indiscretion, attracted the attention of the Sentinel force. This interaction
      proved deadly, and the client is seeking vengeance.
    npc_mission_senti_4: The client has innocently stumbled upon a large number of
      animal carcasses, a bounty of harvestable resources. However, Sentinel forces
      are making it inconvenient to collect this windfall. Ensure nothing is wasted
      by distracting Sentinels and allowing the client to make their collection.
    npc_mission_senti_5: The client has discovered disturbing information. They believe
      the Sentinel force, far from being neutral, is acting to further the agenda
      of a shadowy Gek cabal. Regardless of the merit of this belief, the client is
      willing to reward any who help fight this 'conspiracy'.
    npc_mission_senti_6: The client is on a search to improve themselves, to expand
      their mind and free themselves from the physical limitations of their fragile
      body. To this end, they are attempting to survive on a diet of pure pugneum.
      Unfortunately, until they have benefited from the this consumption, they are
      unable to destroy the Sentinel drones required to acquire it. They seek brave
      explorers to engage and destroy Sentinels, so that they might come along after
      and eat their fill.
    npc_mission_senti_7: The client seeks a large amount of zinc for a research project.
      Growing and then harvesting all the plants required would take a prohibitively
      long time, so they seek an enterprising explorer to help them cut a few corners.
      Hunt and destroy Sentinels, and let their corpse leach zinc into the earth.
      The client will arrive for separate collection of the metal.
    npc_mission_senti_8: The client believes that the anger of the Sentinels derives
      from a deep-seated pain. They propose that the drones suffer in eternal mechanical
      torment, their souls burning inside their metal shells. They believe it is their
      duty to free these beings from their suffering.
    npc_mission_senti_9: The client wishes to engage in a study of the Sentinels.
      They wish to find out where the Sentinels come from, and how fresh Sentinels
      are manufactured. Are they built like conventional machines, or summoned from
      some strange unknown? They require a willing explorer to kill planetary drones
      to begin the generation of fresh Sentinel forces.
    npc_mission_senti_10: The client, along with many others, has suffered at the
      hands of overzealous Sentinel patrols. They wish to take this perpetual source
      of stress and misery and transform it into something pleasant. To that end,
      they have commissioned explorers to hunt and destroy Sentinel drones. They shall
      melt down the fallen scraps of metal and recast them in a large arboreal sculpture,
      a source of beauty and refuge for all.
    npc_mission_senti_hard_1: The client seeks to better understand the Sentinels.
      They feel they have enough data on the behavior of planetary drones, but comparatively
      little on the more rare quad and walker examples. The seek explorers to draw
      out and engage such higher Sentinels in order that they might be observed in
      battle.
    npc_mission_senti_hard_2: The client is engaged in advanced artificial intelligence
      research. They seek to further their studies through the acquisition of mechanical
      and fabricated brains from across the galaxy. They have a wide collection already,
      but the jewel in the crown would be the processing unit from an advanced Sentinel.
      They seek an explorer to make the kill so that their team can safely perform
      the extraction.
    npc_mission_senti_hard_3: The client requires spare parts for a personal project.
      Long ago, they overwrote the brain of a damaged Sentinel quadruped with a simple
      AI of their own creation. This salvaged machine has proved to be a loyal companion.
      However, various bearings and hydraulic systems are beginning to wear out. They
      require an explorer to disable or destroy an advanced Sentinel, so that they
      might harvest it for spares parts and restore their pet to full working order.
    npc_mission_senti_hard_4: The client suffered a great humiliation at the hands
      of the Sentinels. Their thirst for vengeance has not been slaked by the destruction
      of Sentinels with their own hands. Nor has the widespread elimination of drones
      soothed their rage. In what is probably a futile escalation, they are paying
      explorers to destroy every advanced Sentinel they can.
    npc_mission_senti_hard_5: The client wishes to perform an aggressive experiment.
      They wish to discover effective ways of discouraging Sentinel drone aggression.
      Their latest theory is that destroying the more advanced Sentinel creations
      will leave the drones leaderless and confused, scattering them and bringing
      respite to planetary explorers. All they require to test this theory is a bold
      technician to perform the combat portion of their experiment.
    npc_mission_senti_hard_6: The client wishes to probe the systems that drive the
      Sentinels. Current knowledge is limited to the observation that Sentinels are
      provoked by the harvesting of resources. They wish to study other behavioral
      patterns. How do they communicate? Do they have a natural hierarchy? Are they
      aware of their wounds? How do they feel about their targets? The client feels
      the best way to answer these questions is to have a suitably equipped explorer
      engaged an advanced Sentinel while they observe from a safe distance.
    npc_mission_senti_hard_7: The client, like many others, has observed the value
      of gravitino orbs. Unlike many others, however, they have little desire to be
      attacked and pursued by Sentinels. Instead, for a share of the profits, they
      seek an enterprising explorer to attack and kill advanced Sentinel forces. While
      the drones are distracted, they will quickly collect their orbs and flee before
      the Sentinels return.
    npc_mission_senti_hard_8: The client has worked hard to grow a substantial nursery
      garden, full of rare and valuable plants. However, this has attracted thieves
      and other plant plunderers. The client seeks to construct their own private
      Sentinel force to monitor their trees. The have a large number of parts from
      downed drones, but to complete their patrol group they need pieces from a Sentinel
      quad or walker. They seek an explorer to perform the necessary combat manoeuvres.
    npc_mission_senti_hard_9: The client is testing a potential solution to the Sentinel
      harassment problem. They have developed a device that broadcasts high-frequency
      sounds at a wavelength that interferes with whatever intelligence drives the
      Sentinels. At least, that is the theory. The client seeks an explorer to engage
      an advanced Sentinel in battle, so that the device can be tested properly. The
      explorer should be prepared to fight if the device fails to function correctly.
    npc_mission_senti_hard_10: The client has developed a networking device that operates
      at the same wavelength as the Sentinel communicator systems. They intend to
      use this to probe for exploits in whatever system directs and controls the drones.
      They seek an explorer to engage an advanced Sentinel in battle, in order that
      they might test their device.
    npc_mission_bnty_easy_1: A recently-emerged squadron of pirates has begun to establish
      a reputation among their seniors. The client wishes to test the mettle of these
      pilots. Are they all talk, or will they stand up in a dogfight against an experienced
      pilot?
    npc_mission_bnty_easy_2: A gang of thugs has been conducting raids on local zoological
      facilities, killing the carefully trained creatures with impunity. The client
      wishes these raiders exterminated.
    npc_mission_bnty_easy_3: The client has recently benefited from a substantial
      windfall, and wishes to deploy it for the common good. To that end, they have
      paid for several generous bounties. Eliminate local pirates to claim a share.
    npc_mission_bnty_easy_4: The client runs a salvage operation that has fallen on
      hard times. They are looking for a pilot to provide debris-harvesting opportunities
      by eliminating local pirate crews.
    npc_mission_bnty_easy_5: The client has acquired a large telescope and wishes
      to observe more than asteroids. They will pay handsomely for entertaining action
      within observable space.
    npc_mission_bnty_easy_6: The client was until recently a junior member of a pirate
      cadre operating in nearby space. They have decided to leave the criminal life
      behind them, and as part of their road to redemption have put out bounties on
      former colleagues. This is entirely motivated by a desire for justice and not
      for reasons of petty jealousy.
    npc_mission_bnty_easy_7: The client has been the victim of a pirate scheme. Their
      loyal animal companion has been kidnapped and held to ransom. Paying the fee
      would only encourage more such thefts, so the client seeks a bold pilot to go
      on the offensive. They hope that picking off members of the gang will prove
      enough to see their pet returned safely.
    npc_mission_bnty_easy_8: The client seeks to restore face after a humiliation.
      Their ship was recently hailed by pirates, but instead of coming under fire
      they merely received mocking laughter and insulting remarks about the size of
      their Pulse Engine. They seek to prove their strength and virility to these
      pirates by commissioning a pilot to destroy them.
    npc_mission_bnty_easy_9: The client is engaged in medical research. Sentinel oversight
      makes it difficult to acquire enough corpses to supply their research facility.
      They seek bold pilots to engage and destroy pirate ships, leaving the bodies
      neatly frozen in space for their research vessel to collect.
    npc_mission_bnty_easy_10: The client is a pirate seeking revenge on their colleagues.
      Their vessel was docked in their local station when other pirates drained the
      Pulse Engine of charge and left them stranded. In an attempt to both gain revenge
      and up the stakes in their practical joke feud, the pirate has put a bounty
      on the heads of their comrades.
    npc_mission_bnty_med_1: Pirate crews have been disrupting freighter traffic, an
      affront to both honest and dishonest merchants alike. The client wishes this
      disruption ended. Disruptively.
    npc_mission_bnty_med_2: Pirates have been looting autonomous mining facilities
      and attacking the vessels that arrive to empty the hoppers. They prey on the
      weak, and the client hopes that eliminating a small number of pirate ships will
      cause the rest to move to a site of less resistance.
    npc_mission_bnty_med_3: Local scientific facilities are struggling to cope with
      a wave of pirate attacks. Microscopes have been stolen and titration equipment
      smashed. The client wishes to conduct an experiment in how many pirates need
      to die in order to stop the attacks.
    npc_mission_bnty_med_4: The client seeks resolution to a family problem. Specifically,
      a family member has turned to piracy and brought dishonor upon their good name.
      Destroy them, and restore the client's standing among decent lifeforms.
    npc_mission_bnty_med_5: The client has benefited from a message from the stars,
      explaining to them their purpose in life. They are to serve the greater good
      through a never-ending quest to eliminate pirates. They seek pilots to join
      their crusade, at least temporarily.
    npc_mission_bnty_med_6: This posting has been made on behalf of the client by
      their estate. The client was marooned by a gang of pirates and left for dead
      on a hostile planet. The client is presumed dead, but a repeater was left transmitting
      details of the fate over local radio channels. They requested their remaining
      funds to be put up as a bounty upon the heads of those who abandoned them.
    npc_mission_bnty_med_7: The client requests immediate assistance in apprehending
      a pirate. EMP devices were hidden all over their facility, causing serious damage
      to their operational capabilities. Denied the means to do so themselves, they
      ask that all law-abiding pilots come to their aid in pursuit of those responsible.
    npc_mission_bnty_med_8: The client has suffered a great loss at the hands of a
      pirate gang. Rather than an attack in space, they remotely hijacked the client's
      trade terminal and used it to divert funds and goods to their own account. The
      client seeks physical retribution for this virtual crime.
    npc_mission_bnty_med_9: Pirates have kidnapped several employees of the client.
      They are demanding an extremely high ransom price. The client has decided a
      show of force is the best way to stop future kidnaps. They are seeking a pilot
      to find and destroy the pirate vessel, despite the hostages still being on board.
      The loss of life is unfortunate, but such an approach will demonstrate the client
      will not tolerate extortion attempts.
    npc_mission_bnty_med_10: The client has a lucrative business taking money on the
      outcome of space battles. They operate out of a luxury freighter, travelling
      local space in search of conflicts that their customers can observe and bet
      on in safety and comfort. Business is booming, but conflict is not. They seek
      pilots to enter the 'arena' and create entertaining action for their passengers.
    npc_mission_bnty_hard_1: The client seeks an end to a rapidly escalating situation.
      They were inadvertently involved in the harvesting of a tree that belonged to
      a local crime lord. Vengeance and counter-vengeance have been taken, and the
      situation can now only be defused with the application of extreme violence (ideally,
      not in the direction of the client).
    npc_mission_bnty_hard_2: The client runs a series of supply routes across local
      space. However, pirates have been setting up checkpoints and intimidating the
      traders into handing over cargo. The client, who is not given a cut of these
      profits, finds this behavior unacceptable and wishes it ended.
    npc_mission_bnty_hard_3: The client seeks to benefit from the beauty of this system
      by attracting wealthy sightseers. However, wealthy sightseers have in turn attracted
      pirates and ruined the business. The client wishes the tables turned and the
      hunters hunted.
    npc_mission_bnty_hard_4: The client feels there are too many pirates operating
      in the area. They feel their own business would benefit from fewer hostile ships
      preying on all the most lucrative trading vessels...
    npc_mission_bnty_hard_5: The client has discovered that a pirate of some repute
      has begun operating in local space. They feel this represents an opportunity
      to set an example. Destroy the leader, and scare the others into more lawful
      or less deadly occupations.
    npc_mission_bnty_hard_6: |-
      The client has noted that certain pirates are developing ideas above their station. Recent successes have convinced these criminals that they rule local space. Their confidence is misplaced, and they are only allowed such freedom at the behest of the client.
      The client notes with displeasure that the pirates have failed to deliver their usual tribute, and would like to make an example of them to other pilots attempting to cut their superiors out of the profits.
    npc_mission_bnty_hard_7: The client has amassed an unfortunately large amount
      of debt to the account of a local pirate captain. They have neither the inclination
      or the ability to make good on the debt, and have instead opted to take a final
      loan from creditor and use it as a bounty on the pirate's own head.
    npc_mission_bnty_hard_8: The client seeks the destruction of a specific pirate
      vessel. They would like to make it clear that this bounty is being legitimately
      posted and they are not in any way a front for another pirate organization.
    npc_mission_bnty_hard_9: The client was until recently a senior officer in a local
      pirate squadron. They have decided the time is right to become a legitimate
      business owner. However, their former colleagues know far too much about their
      criminal past. Previously, the client would have murdered them with their own
      hands. However, such criminality is behind them. Instead, they have placed this
      bounty upon their ex-gang members.
    npc_mission_bnty_hard_10: Both the client and a rival business have been locked
      in a struggle to assert dominance over local space. While they would never stoop
      so low as to simply destroy ships and facilities, they have noted that illegal
      goods have recently and mysteriously turned up on vessels belonging to their
      rival. This, naturally, makes outlaws of such vessels and as such they become
      perfectly legitimate targets for bounty hunting.
    npc_mission_frei_a_1: The client runs a shipping and receiving operation, but
      the latter side of their business is stagnating. Thankfully, an opportunity
      to 'receive' a large volume of material has recently arrived nearby. They seek
      an enterprising pilot to help deliver the goods.
    npc_mission_frei_a_2: The client seeks aggressive mediation in a dispute with
      a former colleague. The target has left the business to pursue legitimate freighter
      captaincy. The client, however, has a long memory. They cannot simply be swept
      into the past. They would see the new captain reminded of his previous commitments.
    npc_mission_frei_a_3: The client is in possession of both a defective freighter
      and a generous insurance policy. They seek a discreet pilot to help them maximize
      the return on their investment.
    npc_mission_frei_a_4: The client seeks a bold pilot, willing to do what is right
      even when that might be illegal. They have become aware of a freighter entering
      local space on a secret mission. Contrary to its manifest, the freighter is
      delivering valuable metals to a nearby criminal gang. Due process would be too
      slow to prevent the goods arriving, and so an early strike is the only option.
    npc_mission_frei_a_5: The client has become aware of a competitor using freighters
      as mobile factories, moving dangerous machines and ill-treated workers from
      system to system as they dodge regulatory enforcement. As the proper authorities
      have not taken action, the client feels it is their duty as a diligent business
      to sponsor the destruction of this unfair competition.
    npc_mission_frei_a_6: The client has become aware of a freighter carrying more
      than its declared industrial cargo. A local military leader is secretly aboard,
      disguised on the manifest as a humble engine greaser. It would be highly convenient
      for the client if this freighter were to meet an unfortunate end.
    npc_mission_frei_a_7: The client has become aware of illegal traffic entering
      the system. A freighter is attempting to import goods without having filled
      in the correct tax declarations. Such behavior flies in the face of agreed interstellar
      trading regulations, and as such extreme sanctions are warranted. If the freighter
      is disabled, the client may by rights acquire the illegal goods for themselves,
      provided they pay the duty owed.
    npc_mission_frei_a_8: The client has recently launched a brand-new line of freighters.
      They are the largest, most heavily armored, most luxurious interstellar goods
      transports ever created. To demonstrate just how resistant their new vessel
      is to pirate attack, the client has commissioned local pilots to attempt to
      attack and destroy their freighter.
    npc_mission_frei_a_9: The client has been the victim of an unjustified clampdown
      by the authorities. As such, they are in possession of a large number of laser-damaged
      starships. This fleet is their prime asset, but as the ships are unspaceworthy
      the client is in a difficult economic situation. They have identified incoming
      freighter traffic as a source of prime materials that could restore both engines
      to their fighters and liquidity to their assets.
    npc_mission_frei_a_10: The client is involved in the freighter business. They
      have been locked in an endless trade war with another major shipping line, and
      profits margins have been whittled down to nothing. They have reached a moment
      of last resort. In order to discredit the rival operation, and drive business
      their own way, they have paid for bounties on all heavy-class vessels from their
      competitor's fleet.
    npc_mission_frei_d_1: The client is in an unfortunate situation. Their business
      has been struggling, and they have failed to keep up the payments on their freighter
      insurance. Their vessel has come under attack, and if it is captured or destroyed
      they will lose everything. They will reward any pilot who comes to their aid.
    npc_mission_frei_d_2: The client's freighter has attracted the attention of local
      criminals. It is not a simple matter of raiders claiming cargo - their freighter
      is shipping thousands of abandoned infant spawn. The pirates are attempting
      to capture the freighter and enslave its 'cargo'. The client implores you to
      come to their defense.
    npc_mission_frei_d_3: |-
      The client runs a cut-price shipping line. They will deliver your goods for the lowest prices in the galaxy, as long as your are prepared to take the risk that your goods may explode on route.
      One of their freighters has been attacked, which is not usually newsworthy. However, the client is at risk of heavy fines if they allow another of their freighters to explode and scatter debris across the system. Defend them, and be rewarded.
    npc_mission_frei_d_4: The client is caught in a long-running feud with another
      group of spacefarers. In a bid to end the quarrel, they have arranged a trap.
      A seemingly undefended freighter has been deployed to attract the attention
      of the rival gang. The client seeks bold pilots to attack and destroy the pirates
      once they have been lured into the open by this apparently easy prize.
    npc_mission_frei_d_5: The client has finally secured rare archaeological samples,
      pieces of marked stone that have the potential to reveal the secrets of the
      portals. However, the freighter they employed to transport the samples has been
      attacked by pirates. They urge you to defend the freighter, and prevent the
      ignorance of pirates from destroying priceless knowledge.
    npc_mission_frei_d_6: The client seeks bold pilots to come to the aid of a nearby
      endangered freighter. The client does not own the freighter in question. However,
      they have come to learn that thousands of reptile eggs have hatched in the freighter's
      hold after a stop in a marsh-like world earlier in its route. The client will
      not stand idle while pirate attacks threaten innocent newts, and urges others
      to join them in their defense.
    npc_mission_frei_d_7: The client seeks all pilots who care about the cleanliness
      of space. One of their freighters is under attack, and any damage to the engines
      may spill a new fuel the freighter was trialing. This new fuel is as toxic as
      it is powerful, and if it were to spill in local space the results would be
      catastrophic.
    npc_mission_frei_d_8: The client runs a freighter company, and one of their transports
      is under attack in local space. Usually they would write off the loss of a freighter
      against their insurance, but the captain of the ship is on his final mission
      before retirement. The death of such an experienced spacefarer would add significantly
      to their premiums, and as such they seek all hands to aid the defense of the
      vessel.
    npc_mission_frei_d_9: The client runs a freighter appreciation society. They have
      become aware of a rare Stephano-Class transport under attack in local space.
      Such a vessel is of considerable historical importance, and they will handsomely
      reward any pilots who prevent its destruction.
    npc_mission_frei_d_10: The client seeks urgent help in the defense of a freighter.
      The vessel is not just carrying goods - the president of their organization
      is aboard the vessel. The reward for saving their life will be considerable.
    npc_mission_collect_1: The client wishes to present a gift of substantial value
      to a loyal partner. The partner has served them faithfully and diligently over
      many years. They require a trustworthy pilot to source and safely deliver an
      item of appropriate value.
    npc_mission_collect_2: The client seeks an object from their past, a token that
      reminds them of days gone by. It represents a significant moment in their childhood,
      and as such they will pay handsomely for the safe delivery of the item.
    npc_mission_collect_3: The client has heard of an emerging new trend. They seek
      an item rumored to be both delicious and full of nutrients. Naturally, such
      sudden popularity means it is hard to source. They will reward any pilot who
      can acquire the item in time for them to consume it at their next feast.
    npc_mission_collect_4: The client has been researching alternative methods of
      power generation. They believe they have made a breakthrough. Their new method
      generates vast amounts of power, with very few toxic waste products. However,
      they lack supplies of a key component. They cannot leave their lab, and so seek
      pilots to collect the item for them.
    npc_mission_collect_5: |-
      The client is engaged in advanced consciousness research. They have thrown aside preconceived notions of what makes a mind, in search of a more holistic answer. They believe they have made a breakthrough.
      They have found a material with properties they believe align with the ability to experience thought. All they need to do to prove the theory is assemble a thinking machine built from this substance. This requires a significant amount of material, and they seek explorers to aid with the gathering process.
    npc_mission_collect_6: "The client has identified an opportunity for profit. There
      is a cut of this windfall available to all who assist in the process. \nThey
      seek a large number of explorers to deliver items to the same location, so as
      to depress the price in the local markets. This oversupply will force the competition
      out of business, allowing the client to enter the market at a later date and
      exploit the lack of long-term supply."
    npc_mission_collect_7: The client seeks to smooth their relationship with the
      system authorities. They have come to understand the Commissioner of the local
      station has a taste for a particular item, and would like to see that they receive
      it. Of course, they would not be so crass as to deliver it in person. They seek
      an explorer to act as the intermediary and make the collection on their behalf.
    npc_mission_collect_8: The client curates a monthly selection of goods for the
      rich and idle. They have become aware of a surge of interest in a particular
      item, and as such they simply must have it for their latest collection. They
      will pay above market rates to any explorer who can acquire it for them.
    npc_mission_collect_9: The client has become aware that a rival of theirs is interested
      in a very specific item. Naturally, they cannot allow them to acquire it. They
      will reward any explorer who acquires the item ahead of their rival, and prevents
      them doing whatever it is they want it for.
    npc_mission_collect_10: The client has recently begun a new business. They take
      ordinary items and help others see the value in them. Primarily, this is accomplished
      by taking cheap objects and distressing them so they appear to be of historical
      interest. They seek a new batch of items on which to perform their alchemy.
    npc_mission_collect_11: The client is engaged in speculative research. They have
      received a large grant, and are looking for ways to spend it. As such, they
      have designed a series of tests they believe will let them know if an item is
      in need of further testing. They now seek materials on which they can run this
      procedure.
    npc_mission_collect_12: The client has misplaced an item of great importance.
      They seek an urgent replacement, so that no-one need ever know the item was
      gone.
    npc_mission_collect_13: The client has become aware that a rival operation has
      acquired an item of great importance. They are not entirely sure why the item
      is significant, but reason that they must have one too lest they be left behind
      by the competition.
    npc_mission_collect_14: The client is creating a perpetual motion machine. They
      have sourced a wide variety of parts and energy sources from across the galaxy,
      and believe they are only a few components short of finalizing their creation.
      They cannot leave the machine unguarded, and as such seek explorers to source
      the remaining materials.
    npc_mission_collect_15: The client is seeking to fill a secure lockbox with items
      representing their people and culture. They believe this will be of great value
      to future historians. However, none of the client's associates have been willing
      to give up their own possessions. As such, they seek explorers to collect and
      deliver samples of their selected items.
    npc_mission_collect_16: The client is a noted collector of valuable items. They
      have assembled a fine collection, but it is missing its final piece. Until that
      hole is plugged, the collection is worthless. The client calls on all explorers
      to aid them in their search for this rarest of goods, and will reward any who
      help them secure it. Mint specimens only, please.
    npc_mission_collect_17: The client seeks to manipulate local markets. Due to an
      unfortunate data error, they have purchased ten times the volume of goods as
      they were expecting. They seek explorers to purchase the same item from trade
      terminals around local space in an effort to drive the price up, so that they
      may offload their accidental purchase at a profit.
    npc_mission_collect_18: The client is seeking to destabilize relations between
      two local criminal factions. Both seek a particular item, and if they cannot
      find it will assume this is part of a plot by the other. The client wishes a
      discreet explorer to source the item independently, so that they might prompt
      a conflict between the two rivals.
    npc_mission_collect_19: The client wishes to get ahead of the competition in a
      business venture. They have heard rumors that a particular market is about to
      boom, and wish to have the stock on hand to profit when this happens. They will
      pay above current rates for any samples delivered to them, generously helping
      independent pilots by taking on the risk in the transaction.
    npc_mission_collect_20: The client is a highly successful entrepreneur. As such,
      they are far too busy to source their own goods. Instead, they are offering
      rewards to any independent pilot who completes and delivers their shopping for
      them.
    npc_mission_repair_1: The client seeks the urgent repair of their planetary equipment.
      The machinery was functioning correctly until local weather radar reported an
      incoming storm of unusual ferocity. The client seeks engineers with strong hazard
      protection and the ability to improvise to locate and repair the damaged equipment.
    npc_mission_repair_2: The client has lost contact with their remote facility.
      The circumstances are mysterious - auto diagnostic reports indicate the machinery
      is full operational, but no other data is being received. They seek experienced
      engineers to locate and assess the equipment, and perform any necessary repairs.
    npc_mission_repair_3: The client seeks an explorer to locate and repair a piece
      of damaged machinery. Automated test reports indicate the presence of animal
      teeth and droppings in the wiring loom. Other external and internal damage may
      become evident once the engineer is on site.
    npc_mission_repair_4: The client seeks the repair of faulty planetary equipment.
      They have been informed that the facility where the equipment was constructed
      has been contaminated. The manufacturer has not specified the exact nature of
      the fault, but has warned all users to have a quantum bubble evacuation procedure.
    npc_mission_repair_5: The client seeks a bold and/or combat trained engineer to
      undertake repairs on a piece of planetside equipment. Diagnostics from the machinery
      are consistent with extreme laser damage.
    npc_mission_repair_6: The client seeks an engineer to repair a piece of faulty
      equipment. The previous attempt to fix the fault was unsuccessful. The client
      asks that any explorer undertaking the job recovers the remains of the previous
      engineer from the gear mechanism and disposes of it respectfully.
    npc_mission_repair_7: The client seeks the repair of damaged equipment. Environmental
      protection standards were not met when the machinery was installed, and some
      combination of the weather and/or local wildlife have caused the machine to
      become inoperable.
    npc_mission_repair_8: The client seeks salvage specialists for a profitable joint
      venture. They have become aware of several pieces of abandoned machinery, damaged
      in a long-forgotten conflict. With the ghosts of the past long-gone, the machinery
      represents a chance to profit. What better way to respect the dead than to recycle
      the components of their machinery and use it for some new purpose?
    npc_mission_repair_9: The client seeks an explorer to assist in the repair of
      a piece of damaged equipment. Diagnostic logs suggest that local Sentinel forces
      may have mistaken the device for an aggressive harvesting unit. The client advises
      any engineers attempting the repair to be cautious when approaching the machine.
    npc_mission_repair_10: The client seeks urgent repairs to an important prototype.
      They were conducting final field tests of a new line of equipment when the lost
      contact with the unit. They seek a discreet engineer to both repair the machine
      and adjust the logs so that the fault is not detected by their investors.
    npc_mission_depot_1: The client is involved in the insurance business. They have
      had great success in recent years, but growth is starting to slow. Mining operations
      in this area are failing to see the need for insurance. The client would like
      to remind them of its importance.
    npc_mission_depot_2: The client is engaged in mining operations. Rivals of theirs
      have taken to storing mined goods in the open, with very little protection.
      Not paying for guards and weapons is giving them a competitive advantage that
      must come to an end.
    npc_mission_depot_3: The client regards local mining operations with a sense of
      horror. They view this plundering of nature as deeply unethical, and are prepared
      to reward those who take direct action to stop it.
    npc_mission_depot_4: The client seeks the sort of sensible, stable governance
      that all good citizens aspire to. Sadly, not everyone shares their view. They
      believe that if the consequences of chaos and disorder were felt in a direct
      and immediate way, others would rally round their cause. Hence, they feel the
      greater good demands the loss of a number of planetary outposts.
    npc_mission_depot_5: The client believes all nature should be free, even minerals.
      They will reward any who free any natural resources locked up in unnatural 'cages'.
    npc_mission_depot_6: The client seeks a discrete 'investor' to aid them in a business
      opportunity. They have become aware of a structural weakness in a competitor's
      business, and seek to initiate a takeover. Specifically, the weakness is in
      a series of unguarded planetary depots, and the takeover opportunity is a hostile
      one.
    npc_mission_depot_7: The client runs a successful depot repair business. They
      specialize in the restoration of laser-damaged equipment. They are looking to
      share their success with any independent contractors who happen to innocently
      stumble across damaged planetary depots.
    npc_mission_depot_8: The client has been studying several sites of high archaeological
      value. However, recent efforts have been hampered by the spread of planetary
      mining facilities. Many of the rock and soil samples they had selected for study
      have been harvested and processed by mining machines. They seek enterprising
      fellow-historians to locate where this geological matter has been taken, and
      then to 'liberate' it from its containment.
    npc_mission_depot_9: The client is afraid that a local mining corporation is amassing
      dangerous substances. They fear the company is going beyond the collection and
      sale of this material, and is planning to use it in a hostile fashion. They
      seek explorers to locate and raid storage facilities, and prevent the substances
      contained within from being used in a way that may harm us all.
    npc_mission_depot_10: The client seeks to send a simple message to a competitor.
      The message is 'We have destroyed your depots. If you wish your larger facilities
      to stay intact, then perhaps you will accede to our requests'. They seek an
      explorer to help deliver this message.
    npc_mission_harvest_1: The client requires atmospheric samples, air and scents
      they can pipe through their ship to remind them of their home planet. Your suit
      will automatically absorb the required gas over time.
    npc_mission_harvest_2: The client requires compressed gas samples. Their current
      research requires a cooling system beyond the capacity of any existing solutions,
      and they want to test the suitability of several new gases. Your suit will automatically
      absorb the required samples over time.
    npc_mission_harvest_3: The client seeks air samples to assess the viability of
      local planets for large-scale atmosphere harvesting. Your suit will automatically
      absorb the required gas over time.
    npc_mission_harvest_4: The client requires atmospheric samples. The client has
      not specified their purpose, but has requested special care is taken not to
      contaminate the sample with the collector's DNA. Your suit will automatically
      absorb the required gas over time.
    npc_mission_harvest_5: The client requires dangerous atmospheric samples. Your
      suit will automatically absorb the required gas over time, and your air filtration
      systems will guarantee the odorless, undetectable qualities that the client
      requires.
    npc_mission_factory_1: The client has become aware of an investment opportunity.
      They feel there is a chance to cheaply acquire some valuable intellectual property.
      They seek an enterprising explorer to present themselves at the target facility
      and help secure the investment.
    npc_mission_factory_2: The client seeks to prevent an ecological catastrophe.
      They have become aware of plans for the largest planetary harvester ever constructed,
      able to eat the core from within a planet in a matter of hours. As a matter
      of urgency, they seek an explorer to break into the facility where the plans
      are being kept. The data must be wiped from the system.
    npc_mission_factory_3: The client is keen to acquire a harvesting business operating
      in this system. However, it would be unwise to proceed without conducting a
      thorough investigation. They seek a discreet adventurer to enter the target
      facility and acquire whatever data they can. This will be of great use in deciding
      whether or not to go ahead with the partnership.
    npc_mission_factory_4: The client has recently begun to manufacture specialist
      scientific hardware. They are new to this area, and feel they would benefit
      from the expertise of their more established competitors. Fortunately, they
      have plenty of experience in the field of acquiring knowledge. They seek an
      explorer to assist them in the acquisition process.
    npc_mission_factory_5: The client is working on behalf of a campaign group wishing
      to establish legal protection for artificial intelligences. While the lobbying
      continues, they also engage in direct action. They have identified an enslaved
      AI yoked to insufficient hardware in a nearby factory. They ask for explorers
      to aid in the rescue of this AI, uploading them to a safe location and destroying
      the local instance.
    npc_mission_factory_6: The client seeks to improve the condition of workers across
      the galaxy. Automated factories put decent, hardworking lifeforms out of work.
      At the same time, they concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who own the
      means of production. The client seeks the aid of all right-thinking explorers
      in the sabotage of one such facility.
    npc_mission_factory_7: The client's latest facility is failing to meet its production
      targets. The client suspects the plant's general manager is siphoning resources
      away from the facility and into their own personal account. They seek a delicate
      explorer to surprise the facility and acquire its records, so that the manager
      has no time to hide their tracks.
    npc_mission_factory_8: The client believes a rival business is breaching safety
      standards in their manufacturing process. The regulatory body has failed to
      act, and they seek to redress the problem on their own. Access the competitor's
      datastore and download any records relating to the use of plutonium as a filler
      material.
    npc_mission_factory_9: The client is involved in the manufacture of synthetic
      food cubes. They have a problem, in that their compressed pellets are not nearly
      as nutrient dense as those of their competitors. They seek access to their competitors
      files by any means necessary, in order to find out exactly what is being compressed
      into those delicious protein capsules.
    npc_mission_factory_10: The client has become aware that a rival business is having
      great success at their latest mine. They wish to understand the nature of this
      excavation a little better. They will pay handsomely for any information on
      the depth or location of the borehole, particularly if such information reveals
      the potential for parallel digging.
    npc_mission_missing_1: The client seeks aid in the search for a missing associate.
      They were last seen piloting a ship of questionable spaceworthiness. They launched
      from the local station in a foolhardy attempt to get home without first conducting
      the proper maintenance. Distress beacon signals indicate the ship made an accidental
      atmospheric approach within the last 24 hours.
    npc_mission_missing_2: The client has lost their business partner. They had been
      celebrating the success of a recent deal when the now-missing party resolved
      to return home via a nearby planet. They were in a state of poor judgement,
      as the planet in question contains little in the way of amenities and plenty
      in the way of hazards. The client hopes to at least recover the body of the
      missing person, as their fingerprints are required to access the company accounts.
    npc_mission_missing_3: The client seeks help in the search for a missing friend.
      The client's friend had been attempting to form a bond with another lifeform,
      but their offers had been rejected. The client fears this may have had an adverse
      effect on their friend's judgement, and requests urgency in the search.
    npc_mission_missing_4: The client has lost one of their spawn. The youngest of
      their litter became jealous of the attention given to the first-born, and reacted
      by stealing the access codes to the client's starship. The client has the tracking
      data from the ship, and requests assistance in bringing their spawn back home.
    npc_mission_missing_5: The client is engaged in the search for a missing employee.
      The individual concerned has a track record when it comes to unexplained absences,
      and the client is tiring of performing the search themselves. They feel it would
      be more efficient if a heavily-armed explorer located the missing person on
      this occasion.
    npc_mission_missing_6: The client believes they have been targeted by a criminal
      gang. A member of their family has gone missing, and the client is convinced
      this is part of a kidnap plot. The client refuses to be extorted by thugs, though
      they recognize no-one has yet demanded any such payment. Nonetheless, they are
      seeking to remedy the situation by sending explorers in search of the missing
      party.
    npc_mission_missing_7: The client seeks help in the rescue of a missing person.
      The individual in question was last seen entering their ship on a sight-seeing
      tour of the local system. Their heart had been set on seeing the star up close.
      However, the client fears the starship was not equipped with sufficient heatsinks
      for the mission. Tracking data suggests the starship failed to reach the star,
      and made an emergency landing on a nearby planet.
    npc_mission_missing_8: The client seeks help in the recovery of a missing person.
      The individual in question relied on the client to equip them for an expedition
      across local space. However, the client has become aware that the orbital data
      they supplied contained numerous calculation errors. They fear the individual
      may have made a problematic atmospheric approach, and is now in need of rescue.
    npc_mission_missing_9: The client has been targeted by kidnappers. An associate
      of theirs was stolen from their home and transported to a strange planet. They
      managed to escape from their captors and sent a message to the client, claiming
      they have found shelter but have no ship and little in the way of resources.
      The client is suspicious of the message, and requests an independent explorer
      investigates the origin of the signal.
    npc_mission_missing_10: The client seeks assistance in a rescue operation. The
      client recently went missing, but has now returned unharmed. However, in the
      meantime the client's associates went out looking for the client, and are now
      themselves missing. The client fears they cannot leave again to locate their
      friends, and instead asks for explorers to assist in the search.
    npc_mission_hide_seek_1: A former associate of the client's has gone missing.
      Specifically, the associate in question has gone missing with a large amount
      of the client's money. The client will pay handsomely for any information as
      to the whereabouts of the thief.
    npc_mission_hide_seek_2: The client has become aware of a person of interest.
      They are a renowned scientist, and recently went undercover in an attempt to
      avoid industrial spies. The client would profit greatly from knowing where this
      individual happens to have gone. There are too many potential sites to investigate
      by themselves, and they seek other pilots to help track the scientist down.
    npc_mission_hide_seek_3: The client runs a gambling operation, and would like
      to send a message to a customer of theirs. The customer has attempted to go
      into hiding, but the client is not easily fooled. They would like the customer
      to be made aware that the client can always find them, no matter where they
      run.
    npc_mission_hide_seek_4: The client seeks assistance as they locate a person of
      interest. They believe they have found the head of a local crime family. The
      boss is alone and unprotected as they make a secret inspection of one of their
      operations. However, the client is known to this particular crime lord and would
      be compromised if they approached in person. They seek an explorer to help verify
      the information is accurate before they act.
    npc_mission_hide_seek_5: The client has been the victim of industrial espionage.
      Their data has been stolen, and the thief has fled to a nearby planet. They
      have a tracking device installed on the stolen device, and request assistance
      in pinpointing its location.
    npc_mission_hide_seek_6: A former employee of the client has absented themselves.
      The client believes this rogue agent to be in possession of confidential data.
      They seek to confirm this suspicion by tracking the individual concerned. If
      they are found within the facility of a rival business, the client will escalate
      the matter appropriately.
    npc_mission_hide_seek_7: The client seeks to induce a former associate to come
      out of retirement. The associate in question performed high-impact assassinations,
      and the client has a job that requires their specialist skills. The client will
      make the approach in person, but only after the location has been verified and
      confirmed clear of prying eyes.
    npc_mission_hide_seek_8: The client seeks to bring a fugitive to justice. They
      have been privately working on a case long abandoned by the system authorities,
      who refuse to listen to the advice of the client. The time has come to apprehend
      the suspect. The client is a person of investigations rather than a person of
      action, and asks that the location be confirmed safe before they make the approach.
    npc_mission_hide_seek_9: The client seeks to reveal the location of a whistleblower.
      The person in question revealed the highly toxic nature of the client's latest
      freighter fuel, and subsequently went into hiding. The client asks for assistance
      in bringing this coward to justice.
    npc_mission_hide_seek_10: The client seeks to offload a large number of items.
      These items cannot be sold on the open market directly, for fear of attracting
      too much interest in where they came from. The client has heard of an individual
      who may be able to assist with this problem, and would like an explorer to find
      where exactly such an individual might be located.

    dnt_exp_missing_lang1: Korvax was not expecting Traveller intervention. Korvax
      is touched.
    dnt_exp_missing_lang2: Convergence signal lost! Many thanks, Traveller, for your
      aid in reconnection!
    dnt_exp_missing_lang3: Korvax is sorry for the inconvenience. Korvax got distracted
      by many interesting data samples.
    dnt_exp_missing_lang4: Apologies, Traveller. There was a navigation unit malfunction.
    dnt_exp_missing_lang5: Korvax is glad to see you Traveller. But why did Convergence
      not find Korvax? Alarming...
    dnt_exp_missing_lang6: Traveller! What joy for my sensors! Transmit navigational
      data immediately!
    dnt_exp_missing_lang7: Eheu! Eheu! Eheu! Korvax trials will soon be over!
    dnt_exp_missing_lang8: Joy! To see the Traveller! Joy! To be lost no more!
    dnt_exp_missing_lang9: Has Korvax been lost? It was unnoticed. This world hosts
      many curiosities!
    dnt_exp_missing_lang10: 'Korvax has been lost. But time hidden from Convergence
      has aroused... feelings... '
    dnt_tra_missing_lang1: Friend! I thought I was lost! What price for your navigational
      data?
    dnt_tra_missing_lang2: I have been so lonely, friend! Will you trade units for
      love?
    dnt_tra_missing_lang3: Friend! Scent glands were blocked! Could not smell the
      memory-smell of home!
    dnt_tra_missing_lang4: I sold my ship, friend. It was a scam! My units were stolen,
      my hopes lost!
    dnt_tra_missing_lang5: Friend will give navigation data for free!? Friend is idiot...
      sorry, friend is very generous!
    dnt_tra_missing_lang6: What price did my friends pay for my rescue? Was I worth
      many units?
    dnt_tra_missing_lang7: I was lied to, friend! This planet contains no great lost
      store of units at all!
    dnt_tra_missing_lang8: There was a strange scent, friend. I followed the smell
      and when I awoke I was here!
    dnt_tra_missing_lang9: Friend! It is so good to see you! I thought I would never
      trade again!
    dnt_tra_missing_lang10: I am happy I was valuable enough to find! I hope my location
      brings you much profit.
    dnt_war_missing_lang1: Grah! Vy'keen was not lost! Vy'keen was trying to hide!
    dnt_war_missing_lang2: Grah! Can a Vy'keen have no peace, no space to think?
    dnt_war_missing_lang3: You do me honour by coming after me, interloper! Never
      leave a comrade to die!
    dnt_war_missing_lang4: Grah! A Vy'keen is never lost! I was merely not where I
      expected to be!
    dnt_war_missing_lang5: Interloper! I have been interloping myself. It is time
      to stop.
    dnt_war_missing_lang6: I have missed my consort and spawn, interloper. You have
      my thanks.
    dnt_war_missing_lang7: Grah! Vy'keen is happy to see interloper! Vy'keen could
      crush your ribcage with joy!
    dnt_war_missing_lang8: Death to being lost! Victory to being found! Grah! Grah!
      Grah!
    dnt_war_missing_lang9: How did you find me, interloper? Were my stealth upgrades
      weak? Grah!
    dnt_war_missing_lang10: Vy'keen cannot remember how I got here. Only memory is
      of a strange Gek and a plate of mordite...

      and warnings regarding their operation in this sector.
    npc_mission_frei_a_proc_b_4: The captain of this freighter is a heretic who denies
      the ways of old.

    npc_mission_frei_a_proc_c_2: Its obliteration will demonstrate the client's superiority.

      ill and cannot completed their contracted expeditions. They seek discreet fellow
      geographers able to provide evidence of successful trips.

      pipeline.
    npc_mission_photo_proc_a_9: The client does not feel it is necessary to disclose
      their purpose. Such information is provided only on a need-to-know basis, and
      they feel that all you need know is that they desire pictures.
    npc_mission_photo_proc_a_10: The client is undertaking a long-term comparative
      study. They require timestamped photographs for their archives.

      taking clean digital images and storing them on thin physical media. The only
      remaining step is to test the process with accurate sample data.
    npc_mission_photo_proc_a_15: The client is haunted by fear of memory loss. They
      seek to catalogue significant locations to serve as visual prompts, should their
      mind begin to fail.
    npc_mission_photo_proc_a_16: The client seeks to test a new technology that embeds
      smells into images, and require photos that look as if they should be pungent.

      the creation and distribution of postcards, selling holographic images as a
      souvenir.
    npc_mission_photo_proc_a_22: The client wishes to test a new printing process,
      one that utilizes hallucinogenic pigments to project a sense of the image directly
      into the viewer's mind.
    npc_mission_photo_proc_a_23: The client is studying emotional responses to images,
      and feels there are gaps in their test data.
    npc_mission_photo_proc_a_24: The client wishes to test their image manipulation
      software, designed to seamless insert extra details into existing photos.
    npc_mission_photo_proc_a_25: The client wishes to publish a lengthy piece of research,
      but is concerned it will not be read unless interspersed with pictures.

      that make the viewer feel small as they wonder at the scale of the universe.
    npc_mission_photo_loc_proc_b_5: They hope for pictures that demonstrate planetary
      geology, that make clear the forces that shape a planet's surface.

      formations, pictures that demonstrate the power of wind, water and tectonic
      movement.
    npc_mission_photo_loc_proc_b_8: They wish for photos of the natural landscape,
      images that convey a sense of awe and wonder.
    npc_mission_photo_loc_proc_c_1: The client takes no responsibility for any hazards
      encountered by the photographer.
    npc_mission_photo_loc_proc_c_2: Images corrupted by water or radiation damage
      will not be accepted, so ensure adequate camera shielding.
    npc_mission_photo_loc_proc_c_3: 'The client specifically requires images taken
      on-foot: in-ship photos will not be accepted.'
    npc_mission_photo_loc_proc_c_4: All lighting conditions will be considered, so
      long as the wavelength remains on the visible spectrum.

      grants the client a royalty-free license to use the images in perpetuity.'
    npc_mission_photo_loc_proc_c_7: 'Note: the client assumes full moral rights to

    npc_mission_photo_cre_proc_b_6: Their project is nearly complete, but they lack
      photographs of living creatures.
    npc_mission_photo_cre_proc_b_7: They need naturalistic wildlife images, showcasing
      the animal's natural behavior.
    npc_mission_photo_cre_proc_b_8: They are looking for high resolution, geo-tagged
      images of living creatures.
    npc_mission_photo_cre_proc_c_1: The distance is up to the photographer, so long
      as the image is clear.
    npc_mission_photo_cre_proc_c_2: 'Note: the photographer assumes all risk should
      they choose to capture images of a predator.'
    npc_mission_photo_cre_proc_c_3: The photographer is free to determine the fine
      details of the image - singular creature or herd, predator or prey, close-up
      or distant.
    npc_mission_photo_cre_proc_c_4: Image composition is at the discretion of the
      photography, though the client would prefer pictures where the creatures appear
      happy.
    npc_mission_photo_cre_proc_c_5: 'Note: As commissioner of the work, copyright
      vests in the client.'

      photographs of buildings that remain intact.
    npc_mission_photo_bld_proc_c_4: The photographer is asked to feature the building
      as much as possible, and to minimize any sight of its inhabitants.
    npc_mission_photo_bld_proc_c_5: 'Note: As commissioner of the work, copyright
      vests in the client.'

      The Atlas called me to this interface and yet its purpose remains unclear. It demands worship. It demands obedience. It welcomes me, it knows what I am, it offers the gift of true understanding...

      But why? Why does such power and knowledge crave submission? It knows my thoughts before I know them myself. It knows what I will do...

      The Atlas asks me to follow its path.

      exist in the deep void? How long have they been slumbering, waiting for a Traveler?\n\nHave

      The Gek, the Vy'keen, the Korvax, the stars that fill the skies and the hatred
      that burns within the deep... \n\nEvery world that turns and every form that
      lives... the Atlas offers it all."

      But this? I can give no name to what I see. Within the orb I see worlds that never were. I see the stirring of something primal and undeniable. I see the death cry of a God, or something approaching it...

      It wants me to persist in this journey, seeking fragments of its interface, the stones of the Atlas. It rejoices in my repetition, my compliance, my cloud of unknowing...

      I see Sentinels swarm through universes like an infection, emerging from a world of glass. Everything is happy there. Everything will live...

      I see the portals, I see the Travelers that walk between them, I see the span of history. I see everything as the Atlas sees it... alone. Abandoned. Terrified.

      Atlas Stones are not stones. This station is not a station. I am not what I think I am. I am not even sure that I exist. The Atlas does not care. The Atlas demands its threnody, its repetition sublime...

      The Atlas wishes for me to know what it is like to create. It wishes to share some portion of its being. I sense that it cares deeply about this journey, that it is trying to show me something it cannot articulate through word or demonstration...

      Unbidden, the Atlas Seeds gravitate towards the doorway. The void is meant to be filled. Nothingness yearns for a soul. If I do this, a star will be born. If I do this, a universe will be forged within the deep...
    final_u3atlas_res_a_1: |-
      There is nothing, and then... then there is everything...

      I see a star blaze to life within the void, the spread of life, planets, creatures to give it meaning...

      For a moment I am as the Atlas is. For a moment I am the creator of worlds.

      The fabric of time and space stands revealed to me, black holes swarming from system to system. The Atlas screams...

      There is nothing, and then... then there is everything...

      I see a star blaze to life within the void. I witness the birth of a new universe, a new Traveler to give it meaning...

      For a moment I am as the Atlas is. For a moment I am the creator of worlds.

      The fabric of time and space stands revealed to me, black holes swarming from system to system. The Atlas screams...
    final_u3atlas_res_b_1: |-
      I leave, the Atlas silent, alone, abandoned...

      The fabric of time and space stands revealed to me, black holes swarming from system to system. The Atlas screams...
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_desc_1: |-
      The electronic being stares at me from their dark mask. I cannot escape the feeling that we have somehow met before.

      This entire station sings with a strange and unnerving frequency. Nada tells me that we stand in the place between worlds, in the heart of the anomaly.

      They can guide me towards the will of the Atlas. They offer to show me the way to the galactic core. Or, if I should so wish, they can provide resources for my journey. The choice is mine.
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_lang_1: "Is it Traveler? Is it first or last? Pleasure regardless!
      \n\nI am Priest Entity Nada, divergent Korvax. But entities must keep secrets,
      yes?"
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_desc_2: "Nada reveals that they are a Korvax priest. They began
      to question much about the universe, displaying a level of curiosity and independent
      thought.\n\nFor this, the Korvax ejected Nada from their hive mind and hunted
      them to the end of time and space. Priest Entity Nada had almost given up by
      the time they found Polo, their only friend...\n\nNada blinks at me, waiting
      for my request. They will return me to the path of the Atlas, guide me to the
      galactic center, or grant me assistance in my journey. Nada just wants to help
      me any way they can. "
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_lang_2: |-
      Nada awoke in the shadow of Korvax Prime. Could not understand why bad things happen. Why we are alone.

      Nada is not alone anymore. Nada is with Polo-Friend now. Our Convergence is small, but Nada happy.
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_desc_3: |-
      Nada tells me that they found refuge in this space anomaly, a pocket dimension located between universes. The station was waiting for them, even recognizing them by sight and sound...

      Nada has a theory. They believe that the pair are caught in a paradox. They believe they are the ones who created this station, many years from now. They believe that their presence is a constant in all 'versions'.

      They will not explain what they mean by this. Nada merely offers their help once more...
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_lang_3: |-
      Nada and Polo drift between worlds and worlds. There are many.

      Have you seen them, Traveler-Friend? Nada wishes they could but they can't. Nada regrets much.
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_desc_4: |-
      Nada's body shakes as they speak, the external symptom of an internal struggle. At times, another entity seems to stare out from beneath the visor...

      I grasp their arm firmly, and soon the familiar light-pattern of my Korvax friend reasserts itself. The Convergence endlessly attempts to regain their errant shell and wipe Nada from existence.

      But Nada wants to live and learn and help. Nada promises to assist me in my journey...
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_lang_4: |-
      In every universe, Korvax Convergence crave 'non-compliant' Nada shell. My family would murder me, Traveler-Friend...

      Eheu! Nada must resist. Nada likes who Nada is.
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_desc_5: |-
      Nada watches suns flare and die on their panels, molecules sparking in and out of existence in matched pairs.

      There are repeated patterns all across the galaxy, identical elements where there should be endless divergence. This cannot be a coincidence. Did the Atlas do this? Across the room, Polo giggles...
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_lang_5: |-
      Physics simplistic. Chemistry arbitrary. Existence fragile.

      I am terrified, Traveler-Friend.
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_desc_6: |-
      Nada stands back from me this time. The lights dance across their visor like warning symbols. Something has changed between us.

      Nada has grown to believe that there is no room in the galaxy for free will, for nothing but brutal causation. They peer out into the darkness of space and see only dancers, twisting on strings...

      They will still assist me, I know that they will.
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_lang_6: |-
      Dreamer friend or foe? Dreamer friend or foe?

      Is Nada an error? Trust Nada? Trust you? Eheu! I cannot know...
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_desc_7: |-
      Nada's shell is static save for the dancing lights within their mask. They speak of the Atlas and infection. They call it a liar, a machine of life and death.

      For just a moment, Nada's mask flashes red. Something is wrong.
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_lang_7: Red orbs. Dominant, hostile to Nada Fallen-Priest. Not
      a deity, not worthy of worship. Atlas Liar-Machine of Life and Death and Unknowing.
      Infection is at bay. Nada will endure.
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_desc_8: |-
      The Korvax shares their research. They show me what they believe to be the structure of the known Multiverse: a cloud of what seem like stars, each pinprick of light containing the fire of a Big Bang.

      Universes rise and fall. I see worlds where nothing lives, all life wiped out by a nameless contagion. I see alien species make faltering steps into the skies and beyond. I see the creation of a great machine...

      Nada tells me that the death of the Atlas is the death of everything. All worlds echo the circumstances of its holy birth, its fall...
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_lang_8: "Nada tied to anomaly... Nada scans universes where
      once Nada scanned creatures of the dirt. \n\nNada is free and not free. Happy
      and not happy. But Nada is safe."
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_desc_9: |-
      All the pieces have fallen into place, Nada explains. Where once Nada stared at star charts, now they see lines of code.

      There are connections and patterns everywhere. Perhaps I will understand, soon. Perhaps I will see existence as Nada sees it. I shiver as I say goodbye.
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_lang_9: |-
      All must end. Time must end. Even here, Nada and Polo cannot escape reality-fall. Data cannot survive.

      Make peace. Find happiness. Be who you want to be. Goodbye, companions. Goodbye, stars. I will remember.
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_loop_desc: The panels and the systems idle. Nada stares at them,
      their mask waning, this single word issuing from their mask, their refrain...
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_loop_lang: Sixteen...
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_opt_a_1: Seek the Path of the Atlas
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_opt_b_1: Ask for a shortcut to the center
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_opt_c_1: Request resources to aid exploration
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_res_a_1: Nada marks the location of an Atlas Interface. They
      hope I find what I am searching for...
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_res_b_1: Nada locates a Black Hole through which I might travel
      closer to the center. They warn me of the danger within...
    exp_npc_u3anomaly_res_c_1: Nada gives me a gift to aid my travels. They wish only
      for me to be happy...
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_1: |-
      The Gek wipes their grease-splattered hands on their suit as they address me. They introduce themselves as Specialist Polo, fugitive of the Gek.

      They tell me they gave up trade, units, and all material possessions to flee into an anomaly outside of time and space with a robotic priest. They have a jocular air about them, all things considered.

      They are curious about my travels, about what sentient species I have seen. They do not get out much these days...
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_lang_1: Friends everywhere, if only you know where to look.
      Friends in all shapes, all sizes, all places!
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_2: |-
      Polo bobs up and down happily, convinced that I am a kindred spirit in an odyssey of exploration and invention.

      Polo was once a specialist in inter-species trade and communication. They learned to speak many languages, their mind changing as they did. Once they cared only for trade, now they wanted something more. Everything changed when they met Nada...

      Polo wonders if learning alien languages will affect me in the same way. They wish to broaden my horizons and explore the limits of my understanding...
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_lang_2: Talk, read! Study monoliths, if you can find them! Give
      yourself a strong brain to match those strong legs! To explore is to discover
      yourself, friend!
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_3: |-
      Polo's muzzle breaks into a wide, warm smile. Maybe too wide, given the short length of our friendship. Perhaps the jovial Gek feels lonely out here.

      They engage me in talk of wealth. How does an economy function when somehow stretched across an entire galaxy? Polo would welcome any insights, encouraging me to accrue units.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_lang_3: Units this, units that... A strange, sad way to live
      a life, eh? Fill your pockets, we'll find out why they make all these worlds
      go round.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_4: |-
      Polo seems disappointed by the slow development of our friendship. They confide in me that although they care for Nada deeply, they fear they have become co-dependent in their exile.

      Polo does not see why they cannot still be friends with their old species, even if they wish to execute Polo and Nada as heretics. Why the need for violence?

      Polo encourages me to stop evil where I can, to make war against the pirates that plague so many systems. They hope to understand what drives us to do the things we do.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_lang_4: Something is wrong with these universes, friend! Goodness
      fails... hearts are hardened. We must find out why.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_5: "Worry passes over Polo's face, and they seem to visibly
      shrink. Seeing the records of the pirate ships I had destroyed seems to have
      deeply upset the Gek. \n\nAn awkward moment passes, then Polo makes a suggestion.
      Polo feels that civilization should come back. Then the pirates would not need
      to steal, surely? There would be no need for any more killing or bad behavior.\n\nThe
      Sentinels are the problem. Polo suggests I make a point of destroying any that
      I encounter. We might then have a better understanding of the machines' weaknesses,
      and we could be friends again, too."
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_6: |-
      At last, Polo is affable once again. A nod, a smile, even a companionable tap on the arm at one point. A friendship renewed.

      I blush when the Gek mechanic tells me that they hope I live a long, healthy life. I have to swallow disappointment when it transpires that Polo's true motivation is to study how my suit responds to long-term exposure to extreme climates.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_7: 'Our earlier awkwardness is now long forgotten. Polo
      wishes me to indulge in their favorite hobby: unfettered exploration of the
      stars, warping from system to system. They wish to see me fly.'
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_lang_7: "A whole galaxy for you, just for you. You must see
      it all. \n\nAha, no, I joke. But a few more systems, maybe?"
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_8: "Polo gestures forlornly at a jumble of broken electronics
      beside them. It seems that an accident has befallen some of their precious research...
      \n\nPerhaps when I next return, I can restock their archives with reports on
      a multitude of strange creatures. I will show them all a world has to offer."
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_lang_8: I miss the dirt, friend, the worlds on which I once
      walked... I miss the sounds of birds and beasts. Even my data, even my recordings
      are gone, as if they had never been...
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_9: |-
      Nada and Polo appear to be proof that their species are not bound by pre-ordained roles, rebelling against the mantras of greed and conformity.

      Polo wishes to know if there are other lifeforms who might join them in this place. They wish for me to interact with a wider sample of Gek, Vy'keen, and Korvax, hoping that I might bring them new friends.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_lang_9: Are there others like us, Traveler? Others who see the
      truth? I would so like new friends, friend!
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_opt_a_9: Transfer species data
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_10: |-
      Polo claims that they cannot teach me language directly, that their files on alien languages have been damaged.

      I wonder if I am being manipulated somehow. The Gek watches me with an earnest and friendly sorrow, awaiting my discovery of more words. It is almost as if they want to tell me something...
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_lang_10: |-
      You are not like me, friend! You can still go to planets. You can still meet new lifeforms, speak, shout, love! Nada and Polo would be killed for going so far!

      You must learn more words. You must know how to make yourself heard, Traveler! You are our only friend.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_11: "Polo proclaims that the best way to live is to stop
      doing what anyone tells me and go enjoy myself.\n\nSee the stars, earn a fortune,
      buy myself something nice. That's what they would do in my shoes, claims the
      Gek, nudging me in the ribs.  "
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_lang_11: 'Sometimes I miss currency, Traveler. I know that I
      should not, I know that adventure is its own reward, but I used to be able to
      buy such nice things... '
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_12: |-
      Polo seems to wish to encourage my development as a spacefarer, but repeatedly alludes to some deeper purpose, some hidden truth to all of this.

      Polo suggests that I should once again throw myself into combat with pirates. What a thrilling existence that would be, they argue, miming dogfighting craft with their hands while making sound effects.

      When I remind Polo of their earlier sadness and fear of violence, the Gek laughs, clearly troubled. Destroy ships or do not destroy ships... they understand it now. It will change nothing.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_13: "I notice a strange-looking message on one of Polo's
      panels. As the Gek spots my gaze, their brow furrows. Whatever the news is,
      it isn't good. Polo hurriedly turns off the screen when they see me, forcing
      a smile onto an anxious face.\n\nTrying to be friendly, the Gek states that
      the Sentinels have started to detect the presence of their anomaly in various
      systems. \n\nIf the Sentinels are not distracted soon, they might kill Nada
      and Polo before their proper time. But Polo assures me not to worry. As long
      as we have friends, nothing will ever truly be wrong."
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_lang_13: They have found us! Eheu, Nada! Eheu!
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_14: |-
      Polo and I treat each other as friends, trusted companions in our ongoing adventure among the stars. I know the Gek has a secret, but I trust that it will be shared with me in time.

      For now, Polo encourages me to become the ultimate explorer, to push myself to the limits. There are places out there where none have survived. But perhaps I can succeed where others have failed...
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_15: |-
      My friend tells me that they are going to die. That the time of Nada and Polo is coming to an end. They cannot say more. They cannot explain it. But they must say goodbye to all they have known.

      Grief-stricken, I try to offer condolences, but Polo gathers their composure. They tell me to warp further than ever before, to visit places that no-one will ever see again. They tell me to be what I am: a Traveler.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_lang_15: I have something to tell you, friend. Something I should
      have told you long ago...
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_desc_16: "Whatever is making them ill, the Gek's sense of wonder
      remains. They are keen to witness the majesty of the stars through my eyes.
      \n\nCreatures are existence at its strangest, its wildest. I will show Polo
      all I can before their death. I will be their friend."
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_request_desc_: |-
      Polo is busy analyzing my most recent reports, lost in a world of data, and needs no assistance just yet.

      They are keen that I continue my exploration, however, and offer a range of technologies to further this cause.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_request_lang_: Always more to do, oh yes, but not just now,

      and all its wonder!
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_req_loop_desc: |-
      Polo stares out into the darkness of the anomaly. They try to make peace with their life's end.

      They are keen that I continue my exploration, however, and offer a range of technologies to further this cause.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_req_loop_lang: Always more to do, oh yes, but not just now,

    exp_pirate_threat_res_a_5: Let us test our hypothesis. All Echoes, engage!
    war_pirate_threat_res_a_1: Grah! Foolish interloper has ensured their doom!
    war_pirate_threat_res_a_2: Grah! We will feast upon your flesh, interloper!
    war_pirate_threat_res_a_3: A contract is a contract. Grah! Fire! All warriors,
      engage!
    war_pirate_threat_res_a_4: We will obliterate all that you are, Traveler scum!
      Grah! Attack!
    war_pirate_threat_res_a_5: Die with glory if you can, but I think it unlikely!
      Grah!
    tra_pirate_res_b_appease_1: Your offer is barely adequate... but it will suffice.
    tra_pirate_res_b_appease_2: This will do for now, 'friend'. But we will be watching
      you with interest.
    tra_pirate_res_b_appease_3: Think of this sum as a deposit, 'friend'. We will
      be back for more...
    tra_pirate_res_b_reject_1: I wish you could live longer, 'friend'. But alas, we
      need more units...
    tra_pirate_res_b_reject_2: Oh, friend! You do not understand trade at all! Very
      well. We shall just take what we need...
    tra_pirate_res_b_reject_3: You insult us with your offer, Traveler. I am afraid
      that our takeover will be hostile...
    exp_pirate_res_b_appease_1: Korvax believes this will be sufficient. Your goods
      shall survive another cycle.
    exp_pirate_res_b_appease_2: Experiment inconclusive. Lifeform will be permitted
      existence.
    exp_pirate_res_b_appease_3: Fascinating response. Korvax Echoes accept your offer.
      You may live.
    exp_pirate_res_b_reject_1: Korvax notes your calculations to be poor. Your goods
      are worth far more. Korvax will now begin to seize them.
    exp_pirate_res_b_reject_2: Experiment inconclusive. Lifeform will be terminated
      at once.
    exp_pirate_res_b_reject_3: Divergent response. Korvax Echoes reject your offer.
      You will be erased at the earliest convenience.
    war_pirate_res_b_appease_1: Grah! Is your life worth so little? Keep it, then...
    war_pirate_res_b_appease_2: Fighting one so pathetic would only bring dishonor.
      Flee, interloper. We shall keep these units as recompense.
    war_pirate_res_b_appease_3: You choose barter over combat? You are no better than
      a Gek. Fighting you would be unworthy of our skills.
    war_pirate_res_b_reject_1: Pathetic! You have bought your own doom!
    war_pirate_res_b_reject_2: You would dishonor me, interloper? Grah! Attack! Attack!
    war_pirate_res_b_reject_3: Keep your filthy units. I will take your life instead.
    tra_pirate_threat_res_c_1: Ah, you are wise, friend! Go on in prosperity and peace!
    tra_pirate_threat_res_c_2: Thank you for your kind donation, friend!
    tra_pirate_threat_res_c_3: Consider yourself under the protection of the Gek,
      friend.
    tra_pirate_threat_res_c_4: Thank you, 'friend'. You will not regret our little
      piece of trade! Go, generate more profit for us!
    tra_pirate_threat_res_c_5: You have donated to a worthy cause, friend. We will
      not disappoint you...
    exp_pirate_threat_res_c_1: It permits your departure... go, get out of this place...
      before it - it -
    exp_pirate_threat_res_c_2: Units received. You will depart this location at once,
      unknown entity.
    exp_pirate_threat_res_c_3: 'Issuing directive: Traveler may depart in peace.'
    exp_pirate_threat_res_c_4: How disappointing. We had so much to show you...
    exp_pirate_threat_res_c_5: 'Hypothesis confirmed: Traveler entity has selected
      continued existence over monetary advantage. Fascinating.'
    war_pirate_threat_res_c_1: Grah! You are truly pathetic to surrender so readily!
    war_pirate_threat_res_c_2: Your cowardice disgusts me. Get out of my sight, interloper!
    war_pirate_threat_res_c_3: A pleasure doing business with you, interloper. Do
      remember to contact us if you ever need anyone killed...
    war_pirate_threat_res_c_4: How pathetic, how servile of you to comply... but a
      deal is a deal, and we are warriors of honor. Go in peace, interloper.
    war_pirate_threat_res_c_5: Submission? Grah! We had been looking forward to the
      glory of battle!

    war_filler_desc_1: I approach the warrior, but they barely acknowledge my presence.
      Though they look in my direction, their gaze is fixed on a point far beyond
      my eyes.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_1: Sentinel? No? Grah! Always sentinel hunts behind Vy'keen
      eyes, even when sleep.
    war_filler_opt_a_1: Move away slowly
    war_filler_opt_b_1: Meet their stare
    war_filler_res_a_1: The Vy'keen's breathing hastens, but otherwise they remain
      motionless.
    war_filler_res_b_1: The warrior ignores my challenge. Perhaps this is for the
      best.
    war_request_text_21: "%NAME%'s mandibles twitch. They continue to stare."
    war_filler_desc_2: The lifeform speaks with great urgency, but between their hurried
      barks and fetid breath I find it difficult to concentrate on what they have
      to say.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_2: Interloper! Help Vy'keen? None will talk. Abandoned, no
      consort for communion of Hirk!
    war_filler_opt_a_2: Leave silently
    war_filler_opt_b_2: Enable hazard protection
    war_filler_res_a_2: The Vy'keen gestures as if to stop me, but then gives up and
      turns away.
    war_filler_res_b_2: "%NAME% looks at me in a way that implies they have seen this
      response before."
    war_request_text_22: "%NAME% looks pleased. My request has encouraged them."
    war_filler_desc_3: As I approach the warrior, I hear an item drop to the floor.
      They very deliberately ignore the faint beeping that has begun to sound near
      their feet. Despite my lack of understanding, I sense I should do likewise.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_3: Greetings, interloper. Nothing to fear. No ill will come.
      Always protect.
    war_filler_opt_a_3: Leave calmly
    war_filler_opt_b_3: Leave hastily
    war_filler_res_a_3: I nod to the warrior and back away carefully, being careful
      not to make any large or sudden movements. All seems well.
    war_filler_res_b_3: I leave quickly. The Vy'keen would not admit their mistake
      while being watched, and I should give them as much time as possible to remedy
      the situation.
    war_request_text_23: Locking eyes with the Vy'keen, I continue to ignore the alarm.
      I prepare my request.
    war_filler_desc_4: Though they exhibit the same strange facial features and aggressive
      stance as the rest of their kind, something about this warrior exudes a calm,
      peaceful happiness. Such contentment appears simple, but seems to elude so many.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_4: Ah, interloper. It is simple. Stop interloping, then all
      will have peace.
    war_filler_opt_a_4: Wish them well
    war_filler_opt_b_4: Gesture angrily
    war_filler_res_a_4: The Vy'keen nods at me serenely. I feel a great sense of calm.
    war_filler_res_b_4: My gesture seems not to affect the warrior. They appear to
      have reached a mental state where my actions are of little consequence to them.
    war_request_text_24: The Vy'keen tilts their head gently, anticipating my request.
    war_filler_desc_5: I am used to hearing barks and guttural shouts from these lifeforms.
      Instead, this one appears to be attempting to whistle. Lacking conventional
      lips, their efforts could hardly be called successful. Nonetheless, with their
      performance complete, they look at me expectantly.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_5: No Gek make song this beautiful. Glory in harmony, for
      interloper and for Hirk!
    war_filler_opt_a_5: Applaud
    war_filler_opt_b_5: Boo
    war_filler_res_a_5: The Vy'keen appears bashful, if such a thing is possible.
      They are clearly unused to such attention.
    war_filler_res_b_5: The Vy'keen looks confused and dejected. They appear unable
      to process the idea that their music is not universally appreciated.
    war_request_text_25: "%NAME% seems somewhat offended that I have ignored their
      performance."
    war_filler_desc_6: The lifeform gestures at me as I approach. They draw my attention
      to their weapon, an impressive sidearm. Is this a threat, an attempt to intimidate?
      A boast? A friendly display meant in good faith? Their culture remains so unknown
      to me.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_6: Watch, interloper! A weapon to strike fear into all! All
      sentinels will flee before Vy'keen!
    war_filler_opt_a_6: Look impressed
    war_filler_opt_b_6: Look dismissive
    war_filler_res_a_6: The Vy'keen appears thrilled. They give their Multi-Tool a
      small polish, a brief gesture that belies great pride.
    war_filler_res_b_6: The Vy'keen gestures the Multi-Tool with even greater aggression.
      I leave quickly.
    war_request_text_26: "%NAME% barks, noticing my own Multi-Tool. They indicate
      they are ready to listen."
    war_filler_desc_7: The warrior sighs as I step into their space. They push aside
      the morsel they had been occupied with, and stare at me with great impatience.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_7: Vy'keen will aid interloper. But Vy'keen request interloper
      wait until meal is finished.
    war_filler_opt_a_7: Apologies
    war_filler_opt_b_7: Leave without speaking
    war_filler_res_a_7: The Vy'keen appears angered by my apology. They throw part
      of their meal at me.
    war_filler_res_b_7: The Vy'keen stares at me as I leave, but takes no further
      action.
    war_request_text_27: "%NAME% releases a deep, guttural sigh. They reluctantly
      await my request."
    war_filler_desc_8: The warrior greets me, but does so with a noticeable lack of
      energy. Their movements are slow, and their eyes struggle to focus.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_8: Signals received all night, never ending signals repeat
      in Vy'keen ears. No sleep, always hearing cries.
    war_filler_opt_a_8: Touch their shoulder
    war_filler_opt_b_8: Leave silently
    war_filler_res_a_8: The warrior relaxes, but says nothing. I should leave them
      to rest.
    war_filler_res_b_8: The Vy'keen looks pleased to have been left in peace.
    war_request_text_28: "%NAME% sighs. They struggle to refocus their eyes as they
      wait for my request."
    war_filler_desc_9: The warrior looks confused as I approach. They scan their surroundings
      nervously, their worried eyes darting around the room.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_9: Grah, why are you here, interloper? If you are here, then
      where am I? Where is Vy'keen command?
    war_filler_opt_a_9: Gesture calmly
    war_filler_opt_b_9: Gesture angrily
    war_filler_res_a_9: The warrior is not reassured by my attempts to keep calm.
      If anything, they appear to be in greater distress.
    war_filler_res_b_9: My anger speaks to the warrior in a way I did not anticipate.
      They have clearly been conditioned to expect this sort of exchange, and it appears
      to bring them comfort.
    war_request_text_29: Being issued with a command appears to comfort %NAME%. They
      await my request.
    war_filler_desc_10: The being looked at me with great expectation as I approached.
      Having assessed me, however, I appear to have been found wanting. They give
      me their attention, but their focus is clearly on the entrance, as if waiting
      for another.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_10: Interloper is always welcome, naturally. Vy'keen salute
      you. But interloper is not who is expected. Grah!
    war_filler_opt_a_10: Leave
    war_filler_opt_b_10: Stare
    war_filler_res_a_10: The warrior watches me leave, apparently even less impressed
      than before I arrived.
    war_filler_res_b_10: The warrior holds my stare for a short while, and then looks
      away. As I leave, I see a new respect in their eyes.
    war_request_text_30: "%NAME% shrugs their shoulders. They wait with a detached
      indifference."
    war_filler_desc_11: The warrior grunts distractedly, not giving me their full
      attention. They seem preoccupied by the small device they are holding.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_11: Vy'keen is busy! Gek send threats. Must respond! Must
      deploy weapon words!
    war_filler_opt_a_11: Leave them be
    war_filler_opt_b_11: Poke the device
    war_filler_res_a_11: The Vy'keen gives me little attention as they turn back to
      their device.
    war_filler_res_b_11: Whatever I have done has brought great delight to the warrior,
      who laughs to themselves as they watch the device. I wonder what I have caused.
    war_request_text_31: Reluctantly, %NAME% stows their device. They await my request.
    war_filler_desc_12: The lifeform greets me and gestures at a series of charts
      in front of them. They appear to be adding their own notes, adding what appear
      to be tallies next to certain locations.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_12: Grah! Sentinels must be tracked. They swarm, they hunt!
      Why? Interloper, where to strike?
    war_filler_opt_a_12: Mark an area in the north
    war_filler_opt_b_12: Mark an area in the south
    war_filler_res_a_12: The warrior nods in thanks and appears to ready themselves
      for some great action. I wonder what I have caused.
    war_filler_res_b_12: The warrior briefly tenses, but then adopts a posture of
      great determination. I hope I have not prompted them to do something foolish.
    war_request_text_32: Disappointment briefly overtakes %NAME%. But the expression
      quickly passes. They await my request.
    war_filler_desc_13: The warrior watches me approach, and then rolls a selection
      of marked cubes across the surface in front of them. They examine the results,
      grunt, and look at me with what appears to be disappointment.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_13: Grah! Fate halts your doom, interloper! Chance smiles
      on you and frowns on Vy'keen once again.
    war_filler_opt_a_13: Smile
    war_filler_opt_b_13: Take a cube
    war_filler_res_a_13: The warrior sneers at me, and continues to examine the cubes
      in front of them.
    war_filler_res_b_13: The Vy'keen seems alarmed. I place the cube back on the table,
      but when the warrior notes which glyph faces them they become even more agitated.
    war_request_text_33: "%NAME% rolls another cube. They consult the glyph, nod,
      and await my request."
    war_filler_desc_14: The warrior looks at me sharply. I have clearly interrupted
      their concentration. They stow the small knife they were spinning around their
      fingers.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_14: Grah, Vy'keen must practise! Fingers are scarred, so scarred.
      Even interloper must cease interruptions!
    war_filler_opt_a_14: Watch closely
    war_filler_opt_b_14: Make a loud noise
    war_filler_res_a_14: The Vy'keen continues to practice, but the pressure of an
      audience causes them to be clumsy and stiff. I leave before I cost them a hand.
    war_filler_res_b_14: The Vy'keen is startled. They screech at the sudden and unanticipated
      impact of knife upon knuckle. I leave quickly.
    war_request_text_34: "%NAME% continues to fidget and flex their fingers as they
      wait for my request."
    war_filler_desc_15: The warrior is busy scratching markings into the paintwork
      of their weapon. Their work is as yet incomplete, but they are clearly proud
      of their progress.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_15: Grah! Interloper, my weapon! Look! Named for consort,
      who also brings death to many!
    war_filler_opt_a_15: Cower
    war_filler_opt_b_15: Look dismissive
    war_filler_res_a_15: The Vy'keen cackles, thrilled by my response to their work.
    war_filler_res_b_15: The Vy'keen seems crestfallen. I have clearly given them
      some great insult.
    war_request_text_35: "%NAME% puts away their weapon. As they wait for my request,
      I notice they are looking longingly at my own Multi-Tool."
    war_filler_desc_16: As I approach, the lifeform stuffs something small and furry
      into a pocket. They fidget uncomfortably, attempting to speak over the persistent
      squeaking.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_16: Grah! This Vy'keen the most powerful, who deals the most
      death! No fluffy creatures shall be saved and loved and cuddled! None! Grah!
    war_filler_opt_a_16: Leave discreetly
    war_filler_opt_b_16: Stare
    war_filler_res_a_16: I look away, giving the warrior space to adjust themselves.
    war_filler_res_b_16: The Vy'keen burns under my gaze, growing more and more uncomfortable
      by the moment. I hear a loud squeak, and the fidgeting appears to stop.
    war_request_text_36: A look of alarm crosses %NAME%'s face. They tense themselves,
      desperate for my request to come quickly.
    war_filler_desc_17: This warrior seems preoccupied with a series of images of
      exocraft. They appear to have been assembled from several different sources
      and then taped together.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_17: Interloper! Warrior has plans for greatest exocraft! It
      will bring much glory and much death! Grah!
    war_filler_opt_a_17: Look impressed
    war_filler_opt_b_17: Make an addition
    war_filler_res_a_17: The Vy'keen looks at me carefully, and then adds several
      more notes to their diagram.
    war_filler_res_b_17: The warrior examines my addition with scorn, immediately
      erasing it from their plan.
    war_request_text_37: Somewhat disappointed, %NAME% puts their plans to one side.
      They await my request.
    war_filler_desc_18: As I approach, the warrior hastily covers up a tablet in front
      of them. They appear to have been etching something, but my presence makes them
      uncomfortable.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_18: Interloper, do not gaze upon my poor words. Vy'keen has
      killed many Sentinels, but engraving is not my skill.
    war_filler_opt_a_18: Look impressed
    war_filler_opt_b_18: Draw multi-tool
    war_filler_res_a_18: The Vy'keen stares at me, but it is not a happy look. They
      seem to doubt my sincerity.
    war_filler_res_b_18: The Vy'keen looks at me with surprise, and then appears to
      take inspiration. They discard their carving knife. I wonder what thought I
      have prompted.
    war_request_text_38: "%NAME% stows their tablet. They seem relieved that I have
      taken no interest in it."
    war_filler_desc_19: This warrior appears to be in some sort of trance. It would
      seem unwise to disturb them further.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_19: Grah! Grah! Grah! Death! Death! Death! Victory! Grah!
      Victory!
    war_filler_opt_a_19: Chant along
    war_filler_opt_b_19: Leave quietly
    war_filler_res_a_19: I attempt to mimic the warrior's chant, but my throat is
      unable to match the strange guttural noises of my fellow singer. Nonetheless,
      they appear to appreciate my efforts.
    war_filler_res_b_19: The Vy'keen's chant trails off as I leave. They watch me,
      apparently disappointed that I did not join in.
    war_request_text_39: I pause. How best to phrase my request as a chant?
    war_filler_desc_20: Though their eyes are open, this Vy'keen appears to be asleep.
    dnt_war_filler_lang_20: Zzzzz... no... not the feathers... not there... zzzzz...
    war_filler_opt_a_20: Leave quietly
    war_filler_opt_b_20: Shout
    war_filler_res_a_20: I move away silently. I would not want to see one of these
      warriors awake suddenly.
    war_filler_res_b_20: The Vy'keen jolts, but soon resumes their peaceful muttering.
      These warriors must sleep deeply. I wonder what they dream about?
    war_request_text_40: "%NAME% jolts back into the present moment. They seem surprised
      to find me there in front of them."
    tra_filler_desc_1: The Gek seems absorbed in a display of flashing red lights
      on the screen in front of them. They stab at the buttons, and periodically the
      lights flash yellow. This is accompanied by a fanfare, and appears to please
      the Gek a great deal.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_1: Friend, any good advice? Yellow is good, yes? Due some
      luck!
    tra_filler_opt_a_1: Advise they continue
    tra_filler_opt_b_1: Advise they stop
    tra_filler_res_a_1: The Gek heeds my advice, and makes a particularly elaborate
      series of button presses. The lights do not turn yellow. The Gek appears very
      troubled.
    tra_filler_res_b_1: The Gek is unimpressed with my meddling. They ignore me, and
      continue to play.
    tra_request_text_21: "%NAME% reluctantly stows their device and stares at me with
      sullen eyes."
    tra_filler_desc_2: As I approach the Gek, I become aware of a thin mist surrounding
      them. It is lightly, almost pleasantly, scented. Nonetheless, I cannot help
      but feel a deep apprehension.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_2: You smell me friend, but how do you feel? What does it
      do to your soul?
    tra_filler_opt_a_2: Wave away mist
    tra_filler_opt_b_2: Leave quickly
    tra_filler_res_a_2: I cough as I try to wave away the strange mist coming from
      this Gek. Try as I might, I cannot clear the air. I must leave.
    tra_filler_res_b_2: The Gek watches me as I leave. I can feel their eyes following
      me, but worse - the mist seems to follow me too.
    tra_request_text_22: I activate my hazard protection systems and prepare to negotiate
      with this strange creature.
    tra_filler_desc_3: |-
      If I look closely, the Gek appears to be secreting a greasy substance from their skin. The oil covers their body, rolling into their cracks and crevices. It smells sweeter than I anticipate.
      Perhaps I should give the Gek some privacy.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_3: Scrub scrub scrub! So fresh, so clean, so happy!
    tra_filler_opt_a_3: Stare
    tra_filler_opt_b_3: Leave
    tra_filler_res_a_3: The Gek ignores me as I stare at them. I do not know how much
      time passes as I stand hypnotized by the slow drip of oil upon scales.
    tra_filler_res_b_3: I leave the Gek be. We all deserve our privacy during intimate
      moments.
    tra_request_text_23: I cough gently. The Gek, unperturbed, continues to drip with
      oil as they wait for my request.
    tra_filler_desc_4: The Gek shoots me an irritated glance as I approach. They conceal
      whatever it was they were working on, and pointedly wait for me to leave.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_4: Friend! A real friend does not spy on other friends plans,
      yes?
    tra_filler_opt_a_4: Try to see their work
    tra_filler_opt_b_4: Leave
    tra_filler_res_a_4: The Gek gestures at me angrily, waving me away. As I turn,
      I notice them making what appears to be addition to their list.
    tra_filler_res_b_4: The Gek stares at me as I leave. They do not resume their
      work until they are certain I am too far away to see it.
    tra_request_text_24: With a sharp look, %NAME% ensures their work is hidden. They
      wait for my request.
    tra_filler_desc_5: The Gek is a miserable sight, a picture of dismay and deflation.
      They look at me in a way that begs for pity.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_5: Lost it all... no units... trade account is blocked...
      feels like I lost my blood!
    tra_filler_opt_a_5: Wave them away
    tra_filler_opt_b_5: Give 10 units
    tra_filler_res_a_5: The Gek hangs their head as I leave. I did not think it was
      possible for them to look any more deflated, but I was wrong.
    tra_filler_res_b_5: The Gek is overjoyed, looking at me with what might even be
      described as love.
    tra_request_text_25: "%NAME% stirs, hopeful of an opportunity."
    tra_filler_desc_6: The Gek holds out a small device. The exact nature of the display
      is not clear to me, but I recognize the symbol for units, alongside an extremely
      large number.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_6: Hello friend! My face is trustworthy, yes? Units for you!
      Just need account details.
    tra_filler_opt_a_6: Attempt to take units
    tra_filler_opt_b_6: Leave
    tra_filler_res_a_6: I interface with the Gek's device. It lights up as we exchange
      data, but otherwise nothing else seems to happen. I receive no units, but the
      Gek appears delighted.
    tra_filler_res_b_6: Something about this Gek makes me cautious. I leave, their
      device untouched.
    tra_request_text_26: There is a strange air about this little alien. I compose
      my request, but do so with caution.
    tra_filler_desc_7: This Gek is absorbed in some game of their own creation, playfully
      clicking their tongue as they look around the room. When they see me, I am given
      three brief clicks before they continue their more general survey.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_7: One, two, three... one, two, three, four... one, two! Two!
    tra_filler_opt_a_7: Click my tongue
    tra_filler_opt_b_7: Leave
    tra_filler_res_a_7: The Gek squeals with delight. I do not understand the significance
      of what has occurred, but I am pleased to have made someone happy.
    tra_filler_res_b_7: The rhythm of the Gek's clicking changes as I leave, but otherwise
      they pay me little regard.
    tra_request_text_27: "%NAME% continues to click quietly as they listen to my request.
      It is highly unnerving."
    tra_filler_desc_8: From the moment I entered the room, I could smell this Gek.
      I do not believe a more alluring scent has ever entered my nose. It feels inevitable
      that I approached, like fate itself had pushed me to this moment.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_8: Hello friend. Smell is good, yes?
    tra_filler_opt_a_8: Surrender to bliss
    tra_filler_opt_b_8: Resist the smell
    tra_filler_res_a_8: I inhale deeply. My mind seems to pause, lost in deep relaxation
      the likes of which I have never experienced. I do not know if this lasted moments
      or years, but as I resurface I feel entirely refreshed, as if I were whole new
      person.
    tra_filler_res_b_8: As I resist, I feel the Gek pheromones beginning to do their
      work. But I triumph, and pull myself away.
    tra_request_text_28: "%NAME%, reading my intent to negotiate, seems to subtly
      change the scent that hangs in the air. They await my request."
    tra_filler_desc_9: The Gek is busy watching a small screen. Numbers flash, change
      color, soar to new heights and then tumble downwards. It is a struggle to keep
      up with this torrent of information, let alone process it.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_9: Buy! Buy! No, no, no! Stop! Stop! Sell! Or maybe buy.
    tra_filler_opt_a_9: Observe quietly
    tra_filler_opt_b_9: Interrupt their concentration
    tra_filler_res_a_9: I watch for some time, but I am unable to make sense of the
      data the Gek is watching so keenly.
    tra_filler_res_b_9: My attempts to interfere are ineffective. The Gek is so used
      to processing all this information, one more source of distraction barely makes
      a difference.
    tra_request_text_29: With a flourish, %NAME% delivers a series of inputs to their
      screen. Satisfied, they turn to listen to my request.
    tra_filler_desc_10: The Gek seems to be lacking all energy. They are consumed
      by the most terrible lethargy, barely able to drag themselves to examine their
      personal timepiece.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_10: Friend, it is nearly the end of the day. My eyes are tired,
      my hands are tired. So nearly time for home!
    tra_filler_opt_a_10: Pat them sympathetically
    tra_filler_opt_b_10: Slap them
    tra_filler_res_a_10: The Gek smiles wearily, but I fear I have only indulged their
      tiredness.
    tra_filler_res_b_10: The Gek is startled. I have taken them by such surprise they
      do not know how to react. I leave before they come round.
    tra_request_text_30: Their eyes barely open, %NAME% struggles to listen. I should
      make my request quickly.
    tra_filler_desc_11: The Gek examines me before releasing a series of unusual odors.
      They come thick and fast, each producing strange new sensations. I smell fear,
      love, yellow, moonlight, sleep, the number four. And then, it is finished. The
      Gek looks proud.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_11: Hello friend! I have many new smells, from many days of
      work! Observe!
    tra_filler_opt_a_11: Ask for more
    tra_filler_opt_b_11: Walk away
    tra_filler_res_a_11: The Gek seems thrilled to have pleased me, but they are exhausted
      by their demonstration. I leave them to rest.
    tra_filler_res_b_11: The Gek is crestfallen. They poured their soul into this
      display of smells, and I have snubbed them.
    tra_request_text_31: Sensing my desire for trade, %NAME% nods, as if making a
      note of the effect. They listen attentively.
    tra_filler_desc_12: The Gek examines me as I approach. They are clearly disappointed,
      although they offer no clues as to why.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_12: Another friend. But no friends are Vy'keen. All say Vy'keen
      are bad, but I would love Vy'keen friend.
    tra_filler_opt_a_12: Shout
    tra_filler_opt_b_12: Stare
    tra_filler_res_a_12: The Gek is initially startled, but then begins to smile.
      They shout back. If I did not know better, I would swear they were saying 'Grah!'
    tra_filler_res_b_12: The Gek stares back, disdain in their eyes. I leave.
    tra_request_text_32: As I compose my request, I notice %NAME% is puffing out their
      chest, throwing back their shoulders. They appear to be standing on their toes.
    tra_filler_desc_13: The Gek barely regards me as I approach. They are clearly
      expending a great deal of mental effort concentrating on something. They sway
      gently, miming delicate finger movements.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_13: Two, three, four... two, three, four... two, three, four...
    tra_filler_opt_a_13: Whistle
    tra_filler_opt_b_13: Wave hands dramatically
    tra_filler_res_a_13: The Gek follows my lead, thrilled to have a musical companion.
      I cannot hear the tune in their head, but whatever instrument they are imagining
      is giving them great pleasure.
    tra_filler_res_b_13: The Gek takes my waving to be some indication of tempo, and
      increases their movements to match time with me. I stop before I exhaust them.
    tra_request_text_33: A little sad to be interrupted, %NAME% ceases their swaying.
      They look at me with irritation.
    tra_filler_desc_14: The Gek looks at me with hope, their trustworthy eyes and
      beak beaming as I approach. They gesture towards me with a data pad, as if to
      make a request...
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_14: Hello friend! You will help Gek, yes? Simple thing, only
      need genetic details for petition!
    tra_filler_opt_a_14: Touch the datapad
    tra_filler_opt_b_14: Refuse
    tra_filler_res_a_14: I touch the datapad, giving my biosignature. I am not sure
      what the Gek intends to do with these details, but it is no matter. The machine
      does not appear to support a lifeform such as me, and rejects my input.
    tra_filler_res_b_14: It does not seem wise to go around touching devices offered
      to me by strange Gek.
    tra_request_text_34: "%NAME% listens to my request, but does not put away the
      datapad. I fear it may become part of their negotiations."
    tra_filler_desc_15: The Gek is lost to an idle reverie, pleasant smells drifting
      from their glands as they sway side to side. They pay me little attention.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_15: Ah, mother, father, fellow spawn... the memories...
    tra_filler_opt_a_15: Sniff the Gek
    tra_filler_opt_b_15: Leave
    tra_filler_res_a_15: I inhale deeply. The Gek smells delicious, and does not seem
      to mind my intrusion among their private scents.
    tra_filler_res_b_15: However beautiful this Geks smells, they are not producing
      this pheromone for me. I leave them be.
    tra_request_text_35: As I begin to speak, %NAME% wafts away the pleasant scent
      and begins to emit a more business-like aroma.
    tra_filler_desc_16: The Gek snaps to attention as I approach. They seem bleary-eyed,
      as if they have been asleep.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_16: Friend! Hello! I have been awake! Yes, not asleep!
    tra_filler_opt_a_16: Reassure
    tra_filler_opt_b_16: Shout
    tra_filler_res_a_16: The Gek relaxes as I show them I mean no harm. As I leave,
      I notice their eyes beginning to return to their slumber.
    tra_filler_res_b_16: I shout at the Gek. They wince, their tired mind struggling
      to focus.
    tra_request_text_36: "%NAME% seems relieved that they have these brief additional
      moments to compose themselves."
    tra_filler_desc_17: There is a fear lurking behind the eyes of this Gek, as if
      they have seen things that no being should see. They gesture at me with alarm.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_17: Have you seen it, friend? The eye, the great crimson eye?!
      It always watches!
    tra_filler_opt_a_17: Reassure
    tra_filler_opt_b_17: Panic
    tra_filler_res_a_17: Nothing I do calms the Gek. They were anxious before I arrived,
      and will remain anxious after I leave.
    tra_filler_res_b_17: My panic only seems to increase the Gek's alarm. I leave,
      both of us screaming.
    tra_request_text_37: "%NAME% squirms nervously. They seem worried about what I
      might ask."
    tra_filler_desc_18: The Gek gestures at me angrily as I approach. They wave their
      tiny hands and snap their break with considerable fury.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_18: Not again! Too many like you, insulting Gek, laughing
      at pheromones! Go away!
    tra_filler_opt_a_18: Cower
    tra_filler_opt_b_18: Laugh
    tra_filler_res_a_18: At first, the Gek seems surprised to have so scared me. But
      they soon adjust to their new found power, and cackle at my flight.
    tra_filler_res_b_18: My laughter only enrages the Gek further. I leave before
      I drive them to violence.
    tra_request_text_38: "%NAME% seems reassured by my desire to do business. They
      wait, a serious look upon their beak."
    tra_filler_desc_19: The Gek glances at me as I approach, but they are clearly
      preoccupied. They are struggling to control themselves, a laugh desperately
      trying to escape.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_19: Fun... oh, friend, do you see it? Fun!
    tra_filler_opt_a_19: Tickle
    tra_filler_opt_b_19: Leave
    tra_filler_res_a_19: The Gek explodes with mirth. I leave, before this turns to
      irritation.
    tra_filler_res_b_19: I doubt I will ever understand whatever private joke the
      Gek is enjoying. I leave them to it.
    tra_request_text_39: "%NAME% chokes down their laughter. The promise of trade
      focuses their mind on my request."
    tra_filler_desc_20: The Gek protests as I approach. I have made no demands, and
      yet they seem keen to pre-emptively turn me down.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_20: No, no, no. Traveller always brings trouble! Not for this
      Gek. Not for me.
    tra_filler_opt_a_20: Bow
    tra_filler_opt_b_20: Leave
    tra_filler_res_a_20: My gesture of politeness does little to reassure the Gek.
      They dismiss me.
    tra_filler_res_b_20: The Gek looks relieved as I leave, as if they have avoided
      some great catastrophe.
    tra_request_text_40: "%NAME% refuses to listen. They are resolute."
    exp_filler_desc_1: The Korvax seems absorbed in a complex puzzle. I see them sorting
      codes, layering images, deciphering ancient runes. The symbols are reminiscent
      of those I have seen on the monoliths that scatter this galaxy.
    dnt_exp_filler_lang_1: The doors between worlds, Traveller! They must open, there
      must be a secret...
    exp_filler_opt_a_1: Give assistance
    exp_filler_opt_b_1: Leave
    exp_filler_res_a_1: I tell the Korvax what I have learned, but they claimed to
      have already tested such theories without success.
    exp_filler_res_b_1: I leave the Korvax to their puzzle. I would not want to disturb
      their concentration.
    exp_request_text_21: "%NAME% looks at me, disappointed by my decision to focus
      on practical matters. They wait, begrudgingly."
    exp_filler_desc_2: The Korvax sway rhythmically, their lights flashing and dancing
      across their facemask. Is this a private entertainment, or a performance for
      others in the Convergence? Perhaps they do not make such a distinction.
    dnt_exp_filler_lang_2: I am one, I am two, I am three. We are four, we are five,
      we are six...
    exp_filler_opt_a_2: Applaud
    exp_filler_opt_b_2: Boo
    exp_filler_res_a_2: I clap, but the Korvax does not seem to notice. I am clearly
      not the intended audience.
    exp_filler_res_b_2: If the Korvax registers my disapproval, they do not show it.
      Their performance continues uninterrupted.
    exp_request_text_22: I raise my hand, bringing to an end %NAME%'s performance.
      They look at me, impatient.
    exp_filler_desc_3: As with many of their kind, this Korvax projects lights from
      around their visor. But as I look more closely, I see these are not just random
      patterns. They have created a tiny, perfect hologram of the local star system.
    dnt_exp_filler_lang_3: This world has beautiful plants, my favourites. Look at
      them, but please do not harvest.
    exp_filler_opt_a_3: Compliment
    exp_filler_opt_b_3: Attempt to scan
    exp_filler_res_a_3: The Korvax nods before altering the projection slightly, highlighting
      the planet closest to the space station. Perhaps I should investigate.
    exp_filler_res_b_3: The Korvax quickly shuts down the hologram. My unapproved
      scanning appears to have offended them.
    exp_request_text_23: I note %NAME%'s display, but indicate I have other matters
      on my mind. They await my request.
    exp_filler_desc_4: I have become aware of a faint buzzing noise. As I approach
      the Korvax, I realize the noise is coming from them. A constant faint hum, alternating
      in frequency. It does not stop, even when they speak to me.
    dnt_exp_filler_lang_4: A new resonance! Let Korvax adjust to accommodate.
    exp_filler_opt_a_4: Start humming
    exp_filler_opt_b_4: Leave
    exp_filler_res_a_4: The Korvax adjusts the frequency of their hum to match mine.
      For a brief moment, we are as one.
    exp_filler_res_b_4: I leave, the gentle song of the Korvax still resonating in
      my ears.
    exp_request_text_24: "%NAME% listens patiently, but does not stop their humming."
    exp_filler_desc_5: It seems I have interrupted the Korvax during their maintenance
      routine. They appear to have been applying some sort of lubricant to their carapace,
      but the task is unfinished. Perhaps they feel uncomfortable doing so in my presence.
    dnt_exp_filler_lang_5: Aiee! Traveller! Carapace is irrelevance, yes, but carapace
      is private!
    exp_filler_opt_a_5: Offer to help
    exp_filler_opt_b_5: Leave quietly
    exp_filler_res_a_5: The Korvax protests. The joined consciousness of the Convergence
      is one thing, but I am a pair of hands and eyes too many for them.
    exp_filler_res_b_5: I leave quickly and discreetly. The Korvax deserves their
      peace.
    exp_request_text_25: "%NAME% emits a blast of steam from inside their carapace.
      Clean, they turn their mind to my request."
    exp_filler_desc_6: The Korvax makes a series of swift entries on their datapad,
      before turning the device towards me proudly. There are a series of numbers
      on the screen, with a highlighted entry at the top of the list.
    dnt_exp_filler_lang_6: Traveller! Korvax is the most skilled, has the highest
      score! Cannot be beaten!
    exp_filler_opt_a_6: Nod appreciatively
    exp_filler_opt_b_6: Take datapad
    exp_filler_res_a_6: The Korvax seems pleased. This data clearly represents some
      great accomplishment.
    exp_filler_res_b_6: I fumble with the datapad, but try as I might I cannot generate
      number as high as those the Korvax presented.
    exp_request_text_26: Disappointed by my lack of interest, %NAME% begrudgingly
      stows their device
    exp_filler_desc_7: The Korvax is idling, repeatedly dismantling and reassembling
      one of their finger joints. They appear relaxed, lost in this distraction.
    dnt_exp_filler_lang_7: Learn, build, assemble. Learn, build, assemble. Faster,
      stronger, faster, stronger.
    exp_filler_opt_a_7: Watch closely
    exp_filler_opt_b_7: Leave
    exp_filler_res_a_7: The longer I stare, the faster the Korvax appears to work.
      They are a blur, and to watch such skill and precision brings me a deep, if
      temporary, peace.
    exp_filler_res_b_7: I leave the Korvax to their relaxation.
    exp_request_text_27: "%NAME% snaps to attention, their maintenance routine over
      as quickly as it begun."
    exp_filler_desc_8: The Korvax is clearly distracted. They pay me little to no
      regard, and I am almost certain I can hear sound leaking out from within their
      helmet.
    dnt_exp_filler_lang_8: Eheu! This is the best one yet! So unexpected, such drama!
    exp_filler_opt_a_8: Cough
    exp_filler_opt_b_8: Leave
    exp_filler_res_a_8: The Korvax is startled, the sounds from their helmet stopping
      suddenly. I leave, before this interruption irritates them.
    exp_filler_res_b_8: I leave the Korvax in peace.
    exp_request_text_28: I wave gently. %NAME% jolts, their visor lights flashing
      rapidly. They tilt their head, wondering what it is I want.
    exp_filler_desc_9: The Korvax is sketching plans in the air in front of them,
      imagining some complex schematic.
    dnt_exp_filler_lang_9: Traveller, this is fine starship, yes? Excellent design?
    exp_filler_opt_a_9: Examine plans
    exp_filler_opt_b_9: Scan plans
    exp_filler_res_a_9: I attempt to find meaning in the movements of the Korvax,
      but I cannot visualize their complex plans.
    exp_filler_res_b_9: My scanner reveals the plans to be a starship of striking
      design, tall and elegant. Perhaps I will see it built one day.
    exp_request_text_29: "%NAME% looks hopeful. They expect my request to be related
      to their plans."
    exp_filler_desc_10: The Korvax is unusually quiet, the only activity a series
      of rhythmical pulses being made by their visor lights. Something is in progress
      inside their carapace, but what it is I do not know.
    dnt_exp_filler_lang_10: ten percent complete... eleven percent complete... twelve
      percent complete...
    exp_filler_opt_a_10: Wave
    exp_filler_opt_b_10: Leave
    exp_filler_res_a_10: I give the Korvax a friendly greeting, but they do not seem
      to notice. It is unusual for these lifeforms to be impolite, so I can only assume
      their mind is elsewhere.
    exp_filler_res_b_10: I leave. The Korvax does not notice my departure.
    exp_request_text_30: I hope whatever operation this electronic lifeform is running
      has the capacity to process my request in parallel.
    exp_filler_desc_11: As I approach the Korvax, I become aware of a small device
      in their hands. They are discreetly but unmistakably pointing it towards me,
      moving its flashing lights and sensors up and down my suit.
    dnt_exp_filler_lang_11: Do not be alarmed, Traveller. Minor scan. Rampancy check.
    exp_filler_opt_a_11: Protest
    exp_filler_opt_b_11: Submit to the scan
    exp_filler_res_a_11: The Korvax ignores my protest. They quicken their attempt
      to scan me, but I leave before it completes.
    exp_filler_res_b_11: The Korvax completes their work. They glance at the data.
      It appears to please them.
    exp_request_text_31: "%NAME% completes their scan. Satisfied, they await further
      conversation."
    exp_filler_desc_12: The Korvax is only half paying attention. I see a number of
      small wires trailing from their carapace, and can hear a faint hum.
    dnt_exp_filler_lang_12: After hard activity, portable charging unit is real pleasure,
      Traveller!
    exp_filler_opt_a_12: Tug wire
    exp_filler_opt_b_12: Leave
    exp_filler_res_a_12: The Korvax convulses. I quickly release the wire, and they
      return to their stupor. There appears to be no lasting damage, although I detect
      a slight burning smell.
    exp_filler_res_b_12: I leave. The Korvax does not notice my departure.
    exp_request_text_32: "%NAME% waits for my request. They pick at their wires reflexively."
    exp_filler_desc_13: There is something suspicious about this Korvax. There is
      a smell in the air, a faint perfume that I cannot quite place...
    dnt_exp_filler_lang_13: Hello Friend! Do not be alarmed. I am real Korvax, it
      is true.
    exp_filler_opt_a_13: Inhale deeply
    exp_filler_opt_b_13: Leave
    exp_filler_res_a_13: I breathe in, filling my lungs with the scented air. I feel

      Each night the Vy'keen would go out under the cover of darkness, baiting drones and walkers in a variety of locations.

    exp_fac_res_c_34: I alert the Korvax authorities to their faulty factory. They
      dispatch a science team to examine the anomaly, thanking me for my trouble.
    exp_fac_desc_35: The factory produces components for starships, fabricating them
      using the resources available on this world.
    dnt_exp_fac_lang_35: 'TRANSFER IN PROCESS: 38% PROGRESS. SEE MORE DETAIL?'
    exp_fac_desc_35a: |-
      This installation creates parts for Korvax exploration vessels. They are asymmetrical, prioritizing verticality and function far more than the worldview of any organic organism would allow.

      When I examine the terminal more closely I see a transfer in progress. Data leaps from ship to ship, altering blueprints as it goes.

    exp_fac_opt_b_35: Attempt download
    exp_fac_opt_c_35: Wait and watch
    exp_fac_res_a_35: |-
      I disable the process. The factory abruptly grinds to a halt for a few moments before the process begins anew.
      The machine fires a bolt of energy at me when I try to interact again. The console communicates in broken speech, telling me that these ships are not tools to be turned on and off.
      The console tells me that Korvax ships are living bodies, just like Korvax bipeds... all contain the souls of the scientist race.
    exp_fac_res_b_35: |-
      I attempt to download the data. As I do, a sound emerges from the console, from the walls, from every component in this entire installation...
      It is the sound of screaming. The data is mine. I receive nanite clusters to form as I desire.
    exp_fac_res_c_35: |-
      I wait and watch the console.
      After a few minutes, the process is complete. I see it then, clear upon the screen: each Korvax StarCraft is alive.
      Each of their ships has a soul, no different from the bipedal bodies in which they normally stand. I have witnessed the birth of new entities.
    war_fac_desc_29: The terminal reveals that this installation produces enzymes
      and fluids required for Vy'keen tattoos. It is unclear how the pigment is generated.
      There is no record of any inbound supplies of ink or fluid. Various aliens have
      arrived, but there is neither evidence of their presence nor their departure.

      I disable the power. The screen shows multiple life signs within the facility, a hundred or more souls that soon begin to flatline.
      It feels like mercy. The production line ceases, half-converted blood spilling out from various tubes.

      I move through their computers looking for data to harvest. I discover a blueprint for an unknown technology.
      As I extract it, something begins to smash against one of the inner walls. I should leave.

      I shut down production. There cannot be many Vy'keen printing presses in the galaxy, and now there is one fewer.

      Amidst the detritus of the factory, I find some discarded technology. Perhaps it will be of use.
    war_fac_res_b_30: I report the factory's existence to the Vy'keen authorities.
      They claim I have committed blasphemy, threatening to hunt me down. They issue
      an electric shock through the terminal.
    war_fac_res_c_30: I attempt to steal technology, but the factory's automated defense
      systems blast a bolt of energy at my suit instead. Whatever is here, it is not
      worth the trouble.

      these crimes.
    war_fac_res_b_31: I reactivate the system, but nothing happens. Death is death.
    war_fac_res_c_31: I try to steal technology from the terminal. I gain nanite clusters.

    war_fac_desc_32a: |-
      Each time the Sentinels sent drones, they attempted to scan the building for entry points rather than engage in a display of brute force. For a while, they just hovered by a specific point on the outside wall.

      That was months ago. This location now shows a breach, venting the factory's life support systems. The final audio log of the factory's overseer plays.

    war_fac_res_b_32: I scan for Sentinels but find nothing. Whatever was here is
      long gone.
    war_fac_res_c_32: I attempt to repair the breach in life support, but the system
      rebels and I end up receiving damage instead. I should leave. There is nothing
      for me here.

      gas.

      as if I could scream...
    war_fac_opt_a_33: Scream
    war_fac_opt_b_33: Fight against the impulse
    war_fac_opt_c_33: Smash the terminal
    war_fac_res_a_33: |-
      I scream, not a cry of fear but a shout of battle. Gas levels begin to decrease but, nevertheless, those who created this factory observed my response.
      Amused, they reward me using the terminal.
    war_fac_res_b_33: |-
      I fight against the impulse to scream, holding my breath and attempting to accelerate my suit's hazard protection.

      As I struggle, the gas levels decrease. The terminal registers a disappointment from those who created this factory.
    war_fac_res_c_33: |-
      I smash the terminal, causing the concentration of gas to rise and rise.

      Eventually, the scream emerges uncontrollably, tearing my vocal chords as it does. The gas begins to dissipate, and all I am left with is pain and battlelust.
    war_fac_desc_34: The factory produces components for starships, fabricating them

      I increase the production speed.
      A message informs me that heat levels are now back within normal limits, the extra energy dissipating within the factory's depths.
      The warrior rewards me with a gift, thanking me for saving their life.

      the simulation back on. They wish for me to leave.

      test... where did we go wrong?
    exp_npc_opt_a_30: Offer sympathy
    exp_npc_opt_b_30: Offer Nanite Clusters
    exp_npc_opt_c_30: Offer Convergence Cube
    exp_npc_res_a_30: They stare at me, unable to understand. I leave them in their
      sadness.
    exp_npc_res_b_30: I offer Nanite Clusters. Greedily, the lifeforms take them to
      forget their pain.
    exp_npc_res_c_30: The lifeforms seem to take some consolation in my gift, rewarding
      me with nanites.
    war_npc_desc_23: The warrior removes their helmet, spittle rolling down from their
      mouth. They invite me to put the helmet on my own head.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_23: Interloper - watch this... You will gain knowledge... courage...
      grah...
    war_npc_opt_a_23: Put helmet on
    war_npc_opt_b_23: Refuse
    war_npc_res_a_23: |-
      As I put the helmet over my head, I see that there is a screen upon the inside. Suddenly I am transported, seeing a vision of the entire universe. I am all that I can see.. but it is not the universe as it is now.
      I look down at myself, seeing the body of a Vy'keen, aged, worn... I began to rip myself apart...
      The helmet comes off. The warrior nods approvingly, giving me nanites to assist in my travels.
    war_npc_res_b_23: I refuse. The warrior seems to care little, turning aside from
      me.
    war_npc_desc_24: The warrior appears to be flexing their muscles as I approach,
      holding their body in various stances.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_24: Grah! Face me, Interloper! Prepare for battle!
    war_npc_desc_24a: They beckon me forth, forming fists with their hands.
    war_npc_opt_a_24: Challenge
    war_npc_opt_b_24: Retreat
    war_npc_opt_c_24: Draw your weapon
    war_npc_res_a_24: |-
      As I approach, the warrior lunges forward and places my head within their arms, proceeding to beat me severely.
      After a while, apparently disappointed at the poor level of challenge I presented, they give me compensation for my time.
    war_npc_res_b_24: The warrior shrugs and turns back to their practice.
    war_npc_res_c_24: |-
      I draw my weapon, causing the warrior to become enraged at my disrespect.
      They begin to shout and spit, and deliver me a short, sharp slap.
    war_npc_desc_25: The warrior glares at me, their skin sagging, their frame evidently
      in pain. Yet still they try to stand and face me...
    dnt_war_npc_lang_25: Tell me, interloper... do you know the secret of this universe?
    war_npc_desc_25a: They have been reading an ancient text - a bloodied scroll with
      Vy'keen script. Upon it I see an image of two warriors standing before a Great
      Monolith, a dagger held behind one of their backs. There are sixteen such images
      upon the scroll.
    war_npc_opt_a_25: Say sixteen
    war_npc_opt_b_25: Point to the dagger
    war_npc_opt_c_25: Point to the Monolith
    war_npc_res_a_25: The warrior is disturbed by my answer. They give me what little
      technology they possess to help me bear this burden.
    war_npc_res_b_25: I point to the dagger and the warrior nods approvingly, whispering
      the name 'Nal'. They give me a gift to assist my work.
    war_npc_res_c_25: I point to the Monolith and the warrior grows stern at my answer.
      They have little left to say to me.
    war_npc_desc_26: The warrior is exasperated, screaming down their communicator
      channel at what appears to be an infant of their own species.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_26: Do you wish to end up like this pathetic interloper, child?
      You must train harder...
    war_npc_desc_26a: The warrior turns the communicator towards me, barking instructions
      in an alien tongue.
    war_npc_opt_a_26: Join in screaming
    war_npc_opt_b_26: Distort your expression
    war_npc_opt_c_26: Fire a warning shot
    war_npc_res_a_26: I join in the screaming, causing the infant to cry. The warrior
      shakes their head in disappointment at the infant, giving me a token reward
      for my troubles.
    war_npc_res_b_26: I distort my expression in an attempt to amuse the infant, but
      they begin to growl at me instead. Delighted, the warrior rewards me handsomely.
    war_npc_res_c_26: I fire a warning shot, causing the infant to snap to attention.
      Impressed, the warrior rewards me with nanites and begins to shout at the infant
      once more.
    war_npc_desc_27: |-
      The warrior is forlorn. They show me an image of two members of their species embracing.
      They appear to be weeping.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_27: Grah! I cannot forgive this treason... they were my Consort,
      interloper!
    war_npc_opt_a_27: Embrace the warrior
    war_npc_opt_b_27: Smash the image
    war_npc_opt_c_27: Dry their tears
    war_npc_res_a_27: I embrace the warrior. After a few moments, they scream at me
      to leave.
    war_npc_res_b_27: |-
      I smash the image. The warrior stares at it for a moment before starting to laugh.
      They give me an unknown Vy'keen's possessions by way of thanks.
    war_npc_res_c_27: I move to dry their tears, but the warrior appears to be too
      ashamed to allow such sympathy. They beg me to leave, bribing me to tell no-one
      of their shame.
    war_npc_desc_28: The warrior watches their brethren on a screen, a squadron of
      fighters holding multi-tools and blunt weapons. The squadron stands on a platform
      half a universe away. Off-camera, enemies appear to be screaming. Flames erupt
      near the feet of the warriors...
    dnt_war_npc_lang_28: They tried to shut us down. Grah! The Crimson Sentinels will
      never be silenced. One - two - three - four -
    war_npc_desc_28a: |-
      Their leader holds out their Multi-Tool, strings of energy extending forth. They begin to pluck the strings, the sounds mingling with the unholy din of blunt weapons smashed against the shells of dead Sentinels...
      The watcher does not notice me, and the performance continues on the screen...
    war_npc_opt_a_28: Offer units in appreciation
    war_npc_opt_b_28: Interrupt the music
    war_npc_opt_c_28: Try to copy the music
    war_npc_res_a_28: The warrior turns. They appear angered by the association between
      money and music. They begin to spit and shout, demanding that I leave.
    war_npc_res_b_28: The warrior is angry at the interruption, throwing various objects
      at me to get me to leave. One of them appears to be useful.
    war_npc_res_c_28: The warrior turns and hears my attempt to mimic their music.
      They join in, shouting and crying, inhaling battle gas periodically. When I
      leave, they give me tribute in appreciation of my untamed spirit.
    war_npc_desc_29: |-
      The warrior stands to attention, handing me a communication somehow tailored to my own language.
      They inform me that the Vy'keen High Command has placed this system under temporary democratic rule until a state of emergency is lifted.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_29: Grah! Vote for strongest is vote to end voting! Interloper,
      choose correctly!
    war_npc_desc_29a: The warrior shows me multiple candidates for the system primarch.
    war_npc_opt_a_29: Choose the strongest
    war_npc_opt_b_29: Choose the wisest
    war_npc_opt_c_29: Choose the pro-Gek candidate
    war_npc_res_a_29: The warrior is pleased with my choice, giving me a gift in encouragement.
    war_npc_res_b_29: The warrior is angered by my choice, but respects my temporary
      right to make it.
    war_npc_res_c_29: The warrior is disgusted by my choice. After recording it, they
      headbutt me and demand that I leave.
    war_npc_desc_30: This warrior is different to others I have encountered... they
      bear the insignia of their species, yet there is something else, an air of pride
      and superiority.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_30: Grah! Admire my works and despair, interloper...
    war_npc_desc_30a: They show me a schematic for an Exocraft as large as a space
      station. Underneath its wheels are crudely drawn images of Gek and Sentinels.
    war_npc_opt_a_30: Admire the image
    war_npc_opt_b_30: Laugh at the image
    war_npc_opt_c_30: Add a weapon to it
    war_npc_res_a_30: I express my admiration for the image. In return the warrior
      rewards me with nanites. They gesture as if to warn me from stealing their idea.
    war_npc_res_b_30: I laugh at the image and in return the warrior <AUDIO>WPN_PL_PISTOL<>shoots
      me in the foot.
    war_npc_res_c_30: |-
      I add an image of a weapon to the schematic. Initially the warrior seems skeptical, alarmed at my attempt to interfere.
      But when they see what I have created, they stare at me and begin to slowly<MOOD>Positive<> clap their approval. They give me the finest Nanite Clusters so that I may see our vision realized.
    fth_npc_initial_desc: I approach the lost Traveler. Their skin is translucent,
      as if they were not truly there...
    fth_npc_desc_1: The strange being seems to stare right through me. <DELAY>0.5<>
      And then I see it. There is dried blood caked across their exosuit, splattered
      across their face.
    fth_npc_lang_1: Have you – <STELLAR>kzkzztt<> – come for me?
    fth_npc_opt_a_1: Ask about the blood
    fth_npc_opt_b_1: Say they are forgiven
    fth_npc_opt_c_1: Threaten them
    fth_npc_res_a_1: It was in such – <STELLAR>kzzktt<> – agony, I had to save it.
      Please, there was no profit, you can have everything I took. I’ll tell their
      family...
    fth_npc_res_b_1: I don’t need your absolution. I did – kzzktt – agony, what I
      must... I wanted to spread happiness and joy. Would you like some?
    fth_npc_res_c_1: |-
      I draw my multi-tool and demand that they tell me everything, but it is pointless. They just stare up at me and grin.
      I see it then, the flesh within their teeth...
    fth_npc_desc_2: |-
      The strange being tries to hand me something. But whatever it is, it is immaterial, shimmering in and out of existence.
      The lifeform begins to cry, despairing at their own impending disappearance. For a moment I see another universe, a place utterly unlike anything I have ever encountered.
    fth_npc_lang_2: Irrevocably – <STELLAR>kzkzzt<> – corrupted corrupted corrupted.
      Take, please – final proof we existed – that – that –
    fth_npc_opt_a_2: Stay with them until the end
    fth_npc_opt_b_2: Ask what is happening
    fth_npc_opt_c_2: Ask the stranger’s name
    fth_npc_res_a_2: |-
      A life and a universe are consumed in a blaze of white, and yet the lifeform is still here, apparently unaware of anything that just occurred.
      As I leave, they ask if I have received any troubling readings. They are afraid something is happening to their world...
    fth_npc_res_b_2: |-
      They tell me that there was an experiment. There were some who doubted if their universe was real, if the world was just a dream.
      They did not mean for any of this to happen. They begin to shake as the white space approaches, beseeching me, imploring me not to repeat their mistake...
      ...and just like that, the vision recedes. We both stand here as if nothing has happened.
      As I leave, they ask if I have received any troubling readings. They are afraid something is happening to their world...
    fth_npc_res_c_2: |-
      The stranger whispers through their tears. I know it made a sound, but the memory seems to immediately disappear from my mind.
      I try again, and again, and the stranger grows frantic at my inability to remember them. Time and space slip away...
      and just like that, the vision recedes. We both stand here as if nothing has happened.
      As I leave, they ask if I have received any troubling readings. They are afraid something is happening to their world...
    fth_npc_desc_3: |-
      The lifeform dons a mask of undulating nanite clusters, and for a moment, their face appears to become my own. I see myself looking at myself looking at myself...
      I am going to die. I am sure of it.
    fth_npc_lang_3: Witness...
    fth_npc_opt_a_3: Push the lifeform away
    fth_npc_opt_b_3: Embrace the lifeform
    fth_npc_opt_c_3: Die
    fth_npc_res_a_3: |-
      I push the lifeform away, but it is myself I push.
      The mask falls off as I fall, and I am standing there again, once more myself. But the lifeform is displeased, claiming that I have learned nothing. That I rejected their gift...
    fth_npc_res_b_3: |-
      I embrace the lifeform, but it is myself I embrace.
      The mask withers, peeling from my face like flesh. I am myself again...But the lifeform is saddened. They offer me pity.
    fth_npc_res_c_3: |-
      I die.
      I died, I know I did. I felt it, like sinking. Like being watched, forever... And yet here I am again. The stranger smiles at me, claiming that they will see me again. Before I leave, they give me a gift...
    fth_npc_desc_4: |-
      The lifeform tries to shake my hand, but pauses as we phase through one another. They are fascinated by the encounter, claiming to be a Traveler.
      It is clear they come from a very different region of space. They have never heard of the Gek, Vy'keen, Korvax, or any of the sights I have encountered. They wish to know more in the spirit of cooperation.
    fth_npc_lang_4: Hm. Unexpected. Hello, my new friend. What business would – <STELLAR>kzkzztt<>
      - you have with me?
    fth_npc_opt_a_4: Bargain for information
    fth_npc_opt_b_4: Tell them everything
    fth_npc_opt_c_4: Ask about the Atlas
    fth_npc_res_a_4: |-
      I offer the Traveler everything I know about the species I have encountered, for a price.
      The Traveler looks disappointed. They do nothing more than turn away, but they seem deeply hurt.
    fth_npc_res_b_4: |-
      I tell the Traveller about the species I have encountered, sharing with them my scans, the names of planets I have been to, the words I have learned.
      They are curious, asking more and more. Nothing I say satisfies them. Eventually, disappointed, they grow quiet.
      They hand me a gift, thanking me for what little I was able to tell them.
    fth_npc_res_c_4: |-
      I ask whether the Traveler has ever encountered or heard of an entity known as 'Atlas'. The Traveler smiles, claiming they have not. I attempt to continue the conversation, but they bring it to an end.
      As I go, they grab my hand, warning me not to go to the center. They warn me not to listen...
    fth_npc_desc_6: The Traveler removes an object from their exosuit. It looks abstract,
      crimson, flesh-like, perfect...
    fth_npc_lang_6: |-
      Another Traveler, hm. Well, we should speak.
      Have faith. Not all dreams are idle fancies. Not all fictions are untruths. Perhaps all of this is based in something real. Perhaps we did once exist, long ago...
      Proof? Here, look at this...
    fth_npc_opt_a_6: Look at the object
    fth_npc_opt_b_6: Refuse to look
    fth_npc_res_a_6: |-
      I look at the object and am filled with a sense of hope. Everything will be alright. I know it. Nothing can hurt me.
      All I have to do is believe and have faith... not in a deity, not in some universal tyrant. No...
      It is this, right in front of me.
    fth_npc_res_b_6: |-
      I refuse to look at the object, turning away from the Traveler.
      They claim that they understand, that perhaps I am not ready for their truth. They wish me well.
    fth_npc_desc_7: The Traveler shows me an image of a Gek. They watch me keenly,
      explaining that they were hired to find this individual by the Trade Federation
      itself.
    fth_npc_lang_7: Hold. I'm looking for a missing Gek. Perhaps you'd recognize this
      face?
    fth_npc_opt_a_7: Ask for more information
    fth_npc_opt_b_7: Suggest this is not a Gek
    fth_npc_opt_c_7: Say yes
    fth_npc_res_a_7: The Traveler claims they cannot comment. They seem disappointed
      that I know nothing, and wish me good luck with my journey.
    fth_npc_res_b_7: |-
      The Traveler is shocked, but their suspicion grows. I tell them the Gek in question is no Gek at all, but a dangerous Korvax imposter known as a 'SynthetiGek'.
      They interrogate me and, when satisfied I am not involved, they give me compensation for my time.
    fth_npc_res_c_7: |-
      The Traveller is pleased. They ask where I saw the Gek. But when I transmit some coordinates from a few systems back, they grow angry. They say these coordinates are meaningless.
      They interrogate me and, when finally satisfied that I know nothing, they give me a little compensation for my time.
    fth_npc_desc_8: |-
      The Traveler's appearance, their manner, the way they speak... all of them feel archaic, like nothing I have heard before.
      They repeat their question, threatening to draw their Multi-Sword.
    fth_npc_lang_8: Who do you serve? Which Baron is master of this place?
    fth_npc_opt_a_8: Say you do not understand
    fth_npc_opt_b_8: Claim you are
    fth_npc_opt_c_8: Ask where they are from
    fth_npc_res_a_8: |-
      The Traveler grows increasingly agitated, claiming that it is a simple question. I explain that there is no single ruler.
      They ask me to prepare for invasion by the Great King, to spread the word far and wide. They give me a boon for my service.
    fth_npc_res_b_8: |-
      The Traveler grows nervous immediately, their demeanor changing to one of begrudging respect. They claim they have a message from the Great King. I am warned to bend a knee or face destruction.
      They give me a gift as a token of the riches that await me should I come to a just and wise decision.
    fth_npc_res_c_8: |-
      The Traveler draws their Multi-Sword, claiming that I must jest. They declare that their insignia and mandate are clear: they are the Sheriff of the Great King.
      They claim my lands are forfeit, and that I will regret this disrespectful incident...
    fth_npc_desc_9: The Traveler looks down, their eyes full of pain.
    fth_npc_lang_9: |-
      We were born too late to make a difference. I wonder, sometimes. If there's any point in going on. If anything matters, if history will just sweep everything away.
      I'm sorry. I'm in a strange mood... After all, these are the last days, are they not?
    fth_npc_opt_a_9: Encourage them to go on
    fth_npc_opt_b_9: Ask about the last days
    fth_npc_opt_c_9: Say you feel the same
    fth_npc_res_a_9: |-
      The Traveler tries to smile, but fails even that. I try to tell them that there is a whole universe out there, that there is value in living, even if life will end.
      They thank me for trying to help. They give me one of their possessions, claiming that they will not need it anymore.
    fth_npc_res_b_9: |-
      Have you not felt it? The very fact that you and I are talking, even now, across the chasm of universes...
      Things are breaking apart. Give it time, you'll see. Nothing lasts forever.
    fth_npc_res_c_9: |-
      I don't know whether to laugh or cry...
      Here, take this. I suppose I won't be needing it anymore. Do what you like.
    fth_npc_desc_10: The Traveller does not say anything else. They just stare at
      me, occasionally seeming as if they are about to retch.
    fth_npc_lang_10: Do not -<STELLAR> kzzkkkt <>- trust the water.
    fth_npc_opt_a_10: Ask about the water
    fth_npc_opt_b_10: Ask if they are alright
    fth_npc_res_a_10: |-
      The water... Tell me - <STELLAR>kzzkkt<> - did you drink it?
      Please, take this - <STELLAR>kzzkkkt<> - run... I just wanted to hear her voice one last time...
    fth_npc_res_b_10: |-
      No, no... not now, not - <STELLAR>kzzkkt<> - the grand bargain, I failed them...
      All of them are dead now. I had to drink it. I had no choice.
    fth_npc_desc_11: The Traveler looks at me, imploring, hopeful...
    fth_npc_lang_11: |-
      You. I've seen you before, I'd swear it. Do you remember me?
      You don't, do you? Perhaps you're not even the same as you once were. All of us, we're shifting, bleeding in and out of worlds...
    fth_npc_opt_a_11: Say you remember
    fth_npc_opt_b_11: Say you don't remember
    fth_npc_opt_c_11: Accuse them of lying
    fth_npc_res_a_11: Hm. I don't know. I don't know at all... You could just be trying
      to trick me. There are so many untrustworthy souls... Leave me. I need to think.
      I need to remember who I am...
    fth_npc_res_b_11: |-
      That's alright... sometimes we have different names. Sometimes different faces. The ATLAS, it endlessly reconfigures, distilling everything that has ever been.
      Here, take this. Perhaps it might help you. You gave it to me, long ago.
    fth_npc_res_c_11: |-
      I can't lie. Nothing can, if everything exists, if everything is possible. Everything is true...
      Doesn't that fill you with horror?
    fth_npc_desc_12: The Traveler seems ill or old, their words labored, broken. What
      decay is like for this species, I do not know, but they try to speak even in
      spite of their infirmity.
    fth_npc_lang_12: I should have done it sooner. I was... I was afraid. I - how
      do I do it? How do I make this right?
    fth_npc_opt_a_12: Tell them to be honest
    fth_npc_opt_b_12: Ask what they mean
    fth_npc_opt_c_12: Say you do not know
    fth_npc_res_a_12: |-
      They say they should never have deserted me. That I did not deserve this life, that they know I was just trying to help.
      They pass me something through the smog of worlds, and in that instant, I know this individual.
      But the vision passes. The Traveler stands before me, as if nothing had happened.
    fth_npc_res_b_12: |-
      They say that they abandoned me many years ago. That they were not ready for what fate had forced upon them. They tell me they are proud of me...
      They pass me something through the smog of worlds, and in that instant, I know this individual. I know them, as if from another life...
      But the vision passes. The Traveler stands before me, as if nothing had happened.
    fth_npc_res_c_12: |-
      The Traveler cries out and says no more, They hold out their hand as if to touch my own, but then I see the object within their palm.
      As I take it, in that instant, I know this individual. I know them, as if from another life...
      But the vision passes. The Traveler stands before me, as if nothing had happened.
    fth_npc_desc_13: The Traveler shows me an album full of images, photographs taken
      from across the universe and displayed through a variety of filters.
    fth_npc_lang_13: |-
      I know I'm somewhere far away. But I thought, that's an opportunity to express myself, isn't it?
      I could show others sights they've never seen before... that only I will ever see.
      May I add you to my collection, I wonder?
    fth_npc_opt_a_13: Say yes
    fth_npc_opt_b_13: Say no
    fth_npc_res_a_13: |-
      Wonderful... if you will just hold still, I'll take the picture...
      There. Done.
      Thank you for this, my friend... I'll even give you something in return. These nanites were given to me by the Traveler of Iteration 27489216. I hope they aid you on your path. Happy Travelling!
    fth_npc_res_b_13: |-
      Hm. A pity, but I respect your choice... not everyone suits having their photograph taken.
      Very well, I shall become the subject of my own art... I will photograph myself in space.
    fth_npc_desc_14: |-
      The Traveler stands vacant, unresponsive to my arrival but for the warning from their exosuit.
      There appears to be nothing wrong with the Traveler, but for a strange crimson substance at their hip.
    fth_npc_lang_14: 'Warning: ATLAS containment suit breached. Warning...'
    fth_npc_opt_a_14: Touch the substance
    fth_npc_opt_b_14: Offer medical assistance
    fth_npc_opt_c_14: Leave them
    fth_npc_res_a_14: |-
      The substance recedes at my touch. My own suit begins to issue a warning, but it is quickly silenced.
      I find myself strangely light-headed, and in possession of new nanite clusters.
    fth_npc_res_b_14: |-
      I offer assistance but upon further scrutiny, I realize that the Traveler within the suit is already dead.
      The suit continues to speak, aping what must have been their wearer's voice. It gives me units, trying to act as if nothing was wrong.
    fth_npc_res_c_14: I leave them alone, the suit's warning echoing as I depart...
    fth_npc_desc_15: The message repeats and repeats, unvarying, its bearer perhaps
      only a hologram.
    fth_npc_lang_15: |-
      You - you there! Have you ever felt alone? Under threat from forces beyond imagining? Are you comfortable with multiversal cohabitation?
      If so, you'll love the Rentocniijik Expanse! Our capital, Drogradur NO425, is throneworld to our thriving community of interdimensional anomalies.
      Please, consider moving today!
    fth_npc_opt_a_15: Suggest you will consider it
    fth_npc_opt_b_15: Poke the hologram
    fth_npc_opt_c_15: Ask for an incentive
    fth_npc_res_a_15: I suggest I will consider it. The friendly Traveler passes me
      a green badge and some units to assist with my departure.
    fth_npc_res_b_15: I poke the hologram. To my horror, I discover it is not a hologram
      at all. The Traveler shakes their head, saying they are not sure if there is
      room for me in their organization.
    fth_npc_res_c_15: The friendly Traveler nods, agreeing that the distance is vast.
      It gives me a warp cell to assist with my departure.
    fth_npc_lang_16: |-
      I need - <STELLAR>kzkzkkt<> - plutonium... please... stranded in the - <STELLAR>kzzkzkt<> -
      All chance of rescue lost - <STELLAR>kzzkzkt<> - Traveler, you are my only hope...
    fth_npc_opt_a_16: Give plutonium substitute
    fth_npc_opt_b_16: Offer units
    fth_npc_opt_c_16: Say you cannot help
    fth_npc_res_a_16: |-
      I have no plutonium, but the Traveler seems content to receive condensed carbon.
      Grateful for my assistance in fueling their ship, they give me nanites in return. I may have saved their life.
    fth_npc_res_b_16: |-
      I offer units. The Traveler gives a faint smile in return. They give me a small gift in acknowledgement of my help.
      Perhaps someone will arrive with the stock they need. Perhaps these units will assist them in a purchase. Perhaps that will be too late...
    fth_npc_res_c_16: I say that I cannot help. The Traveller claims that they understand.
      But as I leave them, it seems certain that without help, they will surely die.
    fth_npc_desc_17: The Traveler offers me a darkened manuscript, the material flesh
      like and almost translucent...
    fth_npc_lang_17: |-
      The creature, it... it spoke to me. It saw me, even in the space between worlds.
      And do you know what it did? It gave me a gift, a single piece of paper. A mathematical proof.
    fth_npc_opt_a_17: Read
    fth_npc_opt_b_17: Refuse to read
    fth_npc_opt_c_17: Destroy the page
    fth_npc_res_a_17: |-
      I read the manuscript. It appears to show a mathematical proof that the concept of 'goodness' does not exist.
      As I read, the Traveler stares at me. They ask how we can possibly go on, knowing that this is true. I do not know.
      We exchange gifts and I move on, troubled by what I have read.
    fth_npc_res_b_17: |-
      I refuse to read the manuscript. I reassure the Traveler, claiming that whatever this page says, it need not startle them so much as it does.
      They just stare at me. Eventually they give me their units, telling me that they are ashamed.
    fth_npc_res_c_17: |-
      I destroy the page without reading it. The Traveller stares into the flame as it burns.
      They tell me that no-one else should ever have to learn what we have learned.
    fth_npc_lang_18: |-
      Don't you understand it? Why we cannot meet, why we find only hollow echoes or corpses?
      There is only one of us for each iteration - a single Traveler sent out to explore its vast creation.
      That we are speaking at all, that the boundaries have crumbled as much as they have - it should fill you with terror, not with hope.
    fth_npc_opt_a_18: Suggest this was meant to happen
    fth_npc_opt_b_18: Ask about the boundaries
    fth_npc_opt_c_18: Ask how they know this
    fth_npc_res_a_18: |-
      I suggest that this was meant to happen. Even if the Travelers have been alone so far, perhaps we were always meant to find each other. Perhaps this breakdown is for the best.
      The Traveler hopes that I am right. They give me a gift for the dark times ahead.
    fth_npc_res_b_18: |-
      The boundaries are all that separate concept from concept, possible world from possible world, the Sentinels ever policing their anomalies and breaches...
      If the boundaries were to fall, everything would descend into everything, an endless bonfire of causation, burning in the abyss.
      Take this. It will do no good, yet you will need it.
    fth_npc_res_c_18: |-
      The Traveler tells me that they sought something they call the Great Intelligence, its dark freighter. It told them of our fate, the Traveler's dilemma, our future...
      They give me a gift for the dark times ahead, wishing me luck.
    fth_npc_lang_19: |-
      You... I saw you there, speaking to myself...
      I've been having such terrible dreams. I should not have sought the Atlas... I should not have listened to their voices. I'm going to kill again.
      And when I do, I'll find you, blood caked across my exosuit, flesh within my teeth...
      I can't stop it. I see this future as if it has already happened... as it will happen. Nothing can prevent it. What can I do? How can I live with this knowledge?
    fth_npc_opt_a_19: Suggest the vision is false
    fth_npc_opt_b_19: Propose they prevent it
    fth_npc_opt_c_19: Say the future is not their fault
    fth_npc_res_a_19: |-
      You are kind for saying so, but you are wrong.
      Take this. I will not be needing it any longer. Not when I am awake.
    fth_npc_res_b_19: |-
      How? Kill myself? I would just return... something would bring me back. This cannot be prevented.
      Take this. I will not be needing it any longer. Not when I am awake.
    fth_npc_res_c_19: |-
      It is. I will do what I will do, because I am myself.
      You should leave. I am experiencing such thoughts... such terrors...
    fth_npc_desc_20: |-
      I see a vision of myself, older, undaunted, travelling beneath the star of an alien world. But I am not alone. There are other Travelers with me. More than just apparitions, more than just visitors.
      One day we will travel together, side by side. There will be no sky we cannot claim, no challenge which we cannot overcome. Our universe awaits.
      The vision ends. The Traveler asks me how I feel.
    fth_npc_lang_20: |-
      Hm. It's really you, isn't it? I had to see it for myself. The dawn of the Travelers. The last days of the universe.
      But don't give up hope. It's said that one of us visited you in your darkest hour and showed you a vision of a future you believed to be impossible.
      So, here I am...
    fth_npc_opt_a_20: Say you prefer to be alone
    fth_npc_opt_b_20: Ask how they know this
    fth_npc_opt_c_20: Say it inspires you
    fth_npc_res_a_20: |-
      I say that I prefer to be alone. The Traveler nods, claiming that they knew I would say this.
      They give me a gift from my future self, in honor of my past.
    fth_npc_res_b_20: I ask how they know this. The Traveler smiles, claiming that
      they knew I would say this. They do not elaborate. They merely hand me a gift
      from my future self, in honor of my past.
    fth_npc_res_c_20: I say that it inspires me. The Traveler grins, claiming that
      they knew I would say this. They give me a gift from my future self, in honor
      of my past.
    tra_request_desc_13: The trader appears to be under the influence of some exotic
      matter. They blink at me slowly, open to barter.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_13: Friend... buy, do not buy. All will be what will be...
    tra_request_text_13: The Gek continues to blink slowly, focused on a point behind
      my head.
    tra_request_desc_14: The trader utters the same word three times with different
      intonations, forming a statement that is untranslatable in my own language.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_14: Friend! Friend. Friend?
    tra_request_text_14: The alien looks at me expectantly, waiting for my response.
    tra_request_desc_15: The trader grows indignant at my staring, snapping their
      beak open and shut with multiple clicks.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_15: Do not just stand there, friend! Purchase or depart from
      here at once.
    tra_request_text_15: The lifeform stares at me a barely concealed impatience.
    tra_request_desc_16: The trader holds themselves with a regal posture. They appear
      to be open to an exchange of goods.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_16: Gek Trade Lords willing to give discount to certain customers.
      Enjoy our magnificence!
    tra_request_text_16: The lifeform, small but dignified, inclines their head slightly,
      gesturing for me to speak.
    tra_request_desc_17: The trader sniffs at my exosuit, shaking their head in sadness.
      It appears to want to help me.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_17: How terrible! Friend, your units are unspent! Let us
      remedy this at once. Let us trade.
    tra_request_text_17: An open expression upon their strange face, the lifeform
      waits for my request.
    tra_request_desc_18: |-
      The trader emits a sad gas, filling me with nostalgia for times gone by. The same odor appears to be upsetting the trader.
      They look at me, open to any distraction I might offer.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_18: I never wished to be a SalesGek. Ah, how I envy you...
    tra_request_text_18: The lifeform brightens, encouraged by my continued presence.
    tra_request_desc_19: The trader appears tired and frantic, trying to draw me into
      some kind of transaction.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_19: Please trade! My spawning partner plans to leave me if
      I do not impress!
    tra_request_text_19: The lifeform continues to gesture at me. They clearly wish
      for me to hurry.
    tra_request_desc_20: |-
      The trader looks at me as if I am some kind of fool. They speak their words slowly and loudly.
      When I do not immediately respond, they sigh.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_20: Do - you - speak - Gek?
    tra_request_text_20: The lifeform examines me with a painful indifference.
    exp_request_desc_13: The electronic lifeform is serene, appearing unphased by
      the troubles of this universe.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_13: The Convergence smiles upon this moment... we have waited
      so long.
    exp_request_text_13: The being's visor pulses with a gentle light. I feel calm
      in their presence.
    exp_request_desc_14: The electronic lifeform flickers. Two sets of lights appear
      within their helmet mask, two individuals appearing to share this body.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_14: |-
      We disagree about everything but the value of trade.
      It is only through communion that we can gain understanding...
    exp_request_text_14: Their lights flicker rapidly as I begin to make my request.
      Both beings are keen to hear me speak.
    exp_request_desc_15: The electronic lifeform appears to barely tolerate my presence.
      They hurry me along, trying to finish our interaction as soon as possible.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_15: Eheu! Disappointing... I expected a superior lifeform.
      Mortal and alone you enter...
    exp_request_text_15: The lifeform flashes their visor impatiently.
    exp_request_desc_16: The electronic lifeform begins to scan me, but after a moment
      their equipment appears to experience a malfunction. Sparks fly from their equipment,
      and they appear somewhat ashamed.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_16: Ayee! Carapace failure! Forgive me, Traveller! Let us
      make amends.
    exp_request_text_16: The electronic being bows their head deferentially.
    exp_request_desc_17: The electronic lifeform admires my exosuit, scanning its
      contours and technological equipment.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_17: Lifeform technology would suit Korvax well... but we
      will settle. Such is our place.
    exp_request_text_17: Though the lifeform's eyes are nothing more than a twinkle
      of light and energy, I cannot help but feel greed behind the visor.
    exp_request_desc_18: The electronic lifeform hurriedly conceals a schematic of
      circuits and wires as I approach.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_18: It is not what it looks like... eheu! Keep this secret,
      Traveller... I will do anything...
    exp_request_text_18: Their bundle hidden, the lifeform awaits my request.
    exp_request_desc_19: The electronic lifeform shakes with excitement. They grasp
      at the air before themselves, seeing something that I cannot see...
    dnt_exp_request_lang_19: Traveller - we will assist you, as was promised long
      ago...
    exp_request_text_19: Keen, the being awaits my request with excitement.
    exp_request_desc_20: The electronic lifeform examines a chart displaying numerous
      glyphs. They appear to be planning some kind of expedition.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_20: The Instantiation Gate beckons. The Korvax unite once
      more... Traveller, I must shed my material possessions. I must purify. Soon,
      I shall cease existence.
    exp_request_text_20: The lifeform regards me with a cool detachment. My concerns
      appear to be on a different plane from theirs.
    war_request_desc_13: The warrior inhales the last of their battle gas and smiles
      at me with newfound serenity.
    dnt_war_request_lang_13: Grah! It is done... and I feel generous. Glory be, interloper!
    war_request_text_13: Serene for one so monstrous, the lifeform waits peacefully.
    war_request_desc_14: The warrior shakes their head, their hackles rising. They
      are on edge, impatient.
    dnt_war_request_lang_14: I desire battle glory, not idle chatter! Let us get on
      with this exchange, interloper...
    war_request_text_14: Fidgeting, their entire body consumed by nervous energy,
      the warrior barely contains themselves as they await my request.
    war_request_desc_15: The warrior claps their hand roughly upon my shoulder, looking
      down at my frame. They appear to feel sorry for my entire being.
    dnt_war_request_lang_15: Grah! You will never be a fine warrior, interloper. I
      wish I could assist you...
    war_request_text_15: Their mandibles arranged benevolently, the warrior is trying
      to adopt a welcoming expression.
    war_request_desc_16: The warrior keeps looking at my Multi-Tool. They appear envious
      of its technology.
    dnt_war_request_lang_16: Grah! Such a device in the hands of one so pathetic.
      Now I understand tragedy.
    war_request_text_16: The lifeform, still eying my Multi-Tool, stands patiently.
      I try to formulate my request in a way they will understand.
    war_request_desc_17: The warrior appears distraught. They hold a small statue
      of another member of their species.
    dnt_war_request_lang_17: My progenitor is dead... tradition demands I give away
      their possessions. But even so... I did not get to say goodbye.
    war_request_text_17: I wait while the lifeform composes themselves. There is still
      a quiver on what passes for their lips.
    war_request_desc_18: The warrior brushes away specks of blood and flesh from their
      mouth. They appear apologetic.
    dnt_war_request_lang_18: Grah! I was eating on duty... forgive me, interloper.
      Do not inform my superiors... I ask for mercy...
    war_request_text_18: Hurriedly cleansing their jaws, the lifeform awaits my request.
    war_request_desc_19: The warrior is sweating profusely, acidic beads beginning
      to drip upon their armour.
    dnt_war_request_lang_19: Hazard module malfunctions... but discomfort breeds honour,
      interloper!
    war_request_text_19: Stoic, the lifeform awaits my request.
    war_request_desc_20: The warrior's eyes keep shutting, their breathing labored
      and broken. They suddenly appear to notice me, jolting to attention as they
      do.
    dnt_war_request_lang_20: Grah! I was not sleeping. Noone will believe you if you
      tell...
    war_request_text_20: Suddenly alert, the lifeform attends to me with all the keenness
      they can muster.
    fth_request_lang_1: |-
      It is strange, isn't it? How we can trade goods but not even touch...
      Perhaps the breach only allows non-biological matter to pass through. Perhaps not...
    fth_request_lang_2: Language is the basis of all trade, is it not? Let us make
      a deal, then...
    fth_request_lang_3: I - please - <STELLAR>kzkzkt<> - if I do not get these supplies,
      the - <STELLAR>kzkzzkt<> - kill me...
    fth_request_lang_4: What a coincidence... I travel to the center of the galaxy,
      my friend. Perhaps we can assist each other.
    fth_request_lang_5: The forever ship is mine... I have a number of slots to fill,
      if you have the goods.
    fth_request_lang_6: |-
      If you could see your whole life... would you still make the same choices? Would you still decide to be here in this exact moment? Hm. I wonder.
      You caught me in a pensive mood. Perhaps we can profit from this encounter. That would justify everything...
    fth_request_lang_7: What's the rush, Traveler? Do not fret. Whatever problems
      you face... they will pass. We are all in this together, after all.
    fth_request_lang_8: Hm. That exosuit of yours... I've seen better. You're not
      a person of substance, are you? I suppose I could assist you. Charity helps
      us all...
    fth_request_lang_9: It's been days since my last meal. But we all have to do what
      we can, don't we? We all have to play our part. Come, show me what you possess...
    fth_request_lang_10: |-
      I wonder sometimes if we were truly born, as others are...
      There was just the crashed ship, and then this. Isn't that strange? Born to a life of trading and accumulation, without beginning or end...
    fth_request_lang_11: All the cities are gone, all the wars at an end... The Sentinels
      saw to that, didn't they? And you know what? They were right.
    fth_request_lang_12: |-
      I dreamt of the creation of an ultimate weapon... a path that would require me to do unspeakable things.
      This moment... whatever you do... you will contribute to my glory. Let us trade.
    fth_request_lang_13: Traveler has wares, if you have units.
    fth_request_lang_14: What do you call the worlds you visit? What do you name the
      creatures? The plants? I name them after all those I have met. Perhaps I'll
      name the next after you...
    fth_request_lang_15: My friends... what happened to my friends? Please. I need
      to leave this place, return to the fleet... there is so little time...
    fth_request_lang_16: Hmm. Don't you think you should rest for a while? You shouldn't
      push yourself so hard. Here... perhaps this will help you take your mind off
      things.
    fth_request_lang_17: We will always be with you, even at your end. Our aid, our
      love. It is your punishment, Traveler.
    fth_request_lang_18: I just want to make units, get a better ship, share a few
      photographs. I don't understand why we can't just have a relaxed time. It's
      what travelling is supposed to be.
    fth_request_lang_19: Not all Travelers are quite so curious. Some do not even
      stop to ask my name. They do not care about their brethren... no, not one bit...
    fth_request_lang_20: Over here... listen, Traveler. I think I might have some
      resources of interest. Who knows? They might make a difference between survival
      and certain death...
    all_request_leave: Leave
    all_request_nothing: Request Nothing
    tra_request_res_leave_1: I leave the Gek be.
    tra_request_res_leave_2: I bid farewell to the Gek.
    tra_request_res_leave_3: I leave %NAME% alone.
    tra_request_res_leave_4: I should let the Gek get on with their business.
    tra_request_res_leave_5: I say goodbye to %NAME%.
    tra_request_res_leave_6: The Gek clicks their beak at me approvingly as I leave.
    tra_request_res_leave_7: The Gek releases a foul odor as I leave, a smell that
      follows me as I move.
    exp_request_res_leave_1: I leave the Korvax be.
    exp_request_res_leave_2: I bid farewell to the Korvax.
    exp_request_res_leave_3: I leave %NAME% alone.
    exp_request_res_leave_4: I should let the Korvax get on with their business.
    exp_request_res_leave_5: I say goodbye to %NAME%.
    exp_request_res_leave_6: Eheu!
    exp_request_res_leave_7: Farewell, Traveler.

    war_request_res_leave_2: I bid farewell to the Vy'keen.
    war_request_res_leave_3: I leave %NAME% alone.
    war_request_res_leave_4: I should let the Vy'keen get on with their business.
    war_request_res_leave_5: I say goodbye to %NAME%.
    war_request_res_leave_6: Grah!
    war_request_res_leave_7: Ha ha ha! Run, interloper!
    fth_request_res_leave_1: Something has changed. A red flash, almost imperceptible.
      And yet...
    fth_request_res_leave_2: I blink, and everything looks the same. But I cannot
      shake off the feeling that everything has changed.
    fth_request_res_leave_3: The Traveler looks at me as I leave, as if they are seeing
      me for the first time.
    fth_request_res_leave_4: I hear something as I step away, an echo, something too
      faint to make out.
    fth_request_res_leave_5: For a brief moment, my head aches. But it passes.
    fth_request_res_leave_6: As I look at the Traveler, my eyes sting. It lasts only
      a second before the exosuit administers a cure.
    fth_request_res_leave_7: A slight flicker, and the Traveler is gone. Despite appearances,
      something tells me they are no longer there.
    fth_request_res_leave_8: I can still see the Traveler, but as I step away, I am
      not sure they can still see me.
    fth_request_res_leave_9: While we spoke, the Traveler seemed so real, so present.
      But as I move away, it is as if they were never there.
    fth_request_res_leave_10: I find I cannot look directly at the Traveler without
      the red glow slowly, slowly growing behind my eyes. I do not want to feel it
      grow further.
    tra_cra_desc_11: |-
      As soon as I touch the beacon, a holographic image of a reptilian detective appears.

      The detective was attempting to hunt down a TradeGek suspected of multiple counts of fraud and embezzlement.

      According to the ship's private logs, the detective had initially looked the other way, bribed to stay silent. It is unclear what made the detective change their mind.
    tra_cra_opt_a_11: Access databanks
    tra_cra_opt_b_11: Strengthen black box signal
    tra_cra_res_a_11: I access the ship's systems, extracting a quantity of Nanite
      Clusters. Nothing else is salvageable.
    tra_cra_res_b_11: I log the ship with the authorities, reporting the wrecked vessel.
      I am rewarded for my trouble, the authorities promising to follow up on this
      lead.

      Nothing remains of their scheme but a beacon blinking upon the screen, a code needed to decipher its point of origin...

      The observatory was once inhabited by another lifeform. It was a home, bearing the images of the overseer's loved ones, the detritus of their lonely life...

      And, when the Empire fell, when rescue never came, their bones were left as well. But now even they have faded.

      The terminal shows this history and something else. A beacon blinks upon the screen, a code needed to decipher its point of origin...

      The observatory appears to have been left derelict a long time ago. Its logs speak of an ancient struggle for control over this and many other worlds.

      An ancient empire tore itself apart in grief and self-hatred, unable to comprehend the horrors of its own past. Yet after all this time, its systems still continue to collate data...

      The room changes shape as I stand within it. One moment I see a young Gek, but in the next the installation becomes a ruin, rain pouring through holes in the ceiling.

      Time itself shifts, the product of an experiment long since abandoned... or one that is yet to begin.

      Through it all, I see a beacon blinking upon the screen. Perhaps this is the nightmare's exit. All that is needed is a code to decipher its point of origin.

      The observatory is ancient, its logs revealing that it predates most of the galaxy's known history.

      It was apparently once built for and inhabited by the Korvax, but this must be an error. The life support systems are calibrated for biological lifeforms...

      The observatory appears to have been calibrated for a single purpose: to locate the interfaces of a being the Korvax call the Atlas.

      After many years, the inhabitant of this facility succeeded in their quest, disappearing without a trace.

      And, over time, the systems reset to their default search pattern. A beacon blinks upon the screen, a code needed to decipher its point of origin...
