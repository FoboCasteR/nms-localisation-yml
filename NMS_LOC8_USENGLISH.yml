      This setting determines whether the ship will <STELLAR>turn<> (on the "yaw" axis), or <STELLAR>roll<> when moving the ship stick left and right.

      <STELLAR>Stick Turns Ship<> - The in-world stick will turn the ship on the yaw axis. <IMG>ROLLLEFT<> / <IMG>ROLLRIGHT<>, and stick twist (if enabled), will roll the ship.

      <STELLAR>Stick Rolls Ship<> - The in-world stick will roll the ship. <IMG>ROLLLEFT<> / <IMG>ROLLRIGHT<>, and stick twist (if enabled), will turn the ship on the yaw axis.

      Default value is: <CATALYST>%DEFAULTVALUE%<>

    bui_npc_opt_word_get_lore: Autophage symbol
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_fmt: "%SENTA% %SENTB%"
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_a_1: A weary air surrounds this construct.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_a_2: "%NAME% waits, solemn."
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_a_3: "%NAME% looks resigned, their recycled shell already
      beaten down."
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_a_4: The air around %NAME% crackles with nervous energy.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_a_5: "%NAME% appears tense, uneasy in my presence."
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_a_6: This construct appears pensive, on edge.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_a_7: "%NAME% stares at me, somewhat dismissive."
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_a_8: I sense a strange energy about this construct. Not
      quite anger, but some mechanical analogue.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_a_9: "%NAME% seems defiant, unwilling to accept the lot
      fate has thrown at them."
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_a_10: "%NAME% seems relieved, happy to have another entity
      to assist them."
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_a_11: The Autophage hums a faint tune, a digital exclamation
      of joy.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_a_12: My intrusion into %NAME%'s world must be a great
      shock, and yet they seem almost pleased that I am here.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_b_1: Perhaps they know something I do not.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_b_2: How many others have been here before me, I wonder?
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_b_3: I will soon find out why.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_b_4: I will do my best to help them.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_b_5: I wonder what rests on my success or failure here.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_b_6: As we stare at each other, I hear a faint melody
      echoing deep within my Exosuit...
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_b_7: 'I feel my Exosuit react to them: skittish, pulsing,
      its circuits feeding on the Autophage''s energy.'
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_b_8: The air around them glows, the atmosphere warped
      by the atlantideum that powers their shell.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_b_9: Their shell carries the same energy, a metallic
      echo of their inner self.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_mood_b_10: Their atlantidian cloak has been swept aside, and
      they have been revealed to the world.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_biome_1: 'A slow, mechanical music plays out as we face each
      other: the hiss of leaking pneumatics; the slow grind of gears; the high-pitched
      whine of an unbalanced servo.'
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_biome_2: They are lost on this planet, in this universe, and
      looking for their place. We have that much in common...
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_biome_3: How will their shell have changed, by the time we
      meet again?
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_biome_4: Our eyes meet briefly, but if there is meaning in
      their look, I do not understand it.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_biome_5: The hunger this being carries is unmistakable, a
      gnawing desire... but for what?
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_biome_6: I find myself wondering if they miss their old shell.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_biome_7: Torn from their home and carried to this world, left
      to build their own way forwards...
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_biome_8: An environmental warning sounds from my Exosuit,
      but it quickly fades.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_biome_9: I suddenly become very aware of my Exosuit, my own
      mechanical shell...
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_biome_10: Do the other Autophage see them here, on this world?
      Do they have their own Convergence?
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_hot_1: "%NAME%'s metallic casing radiates with the same extreme
      heat that bakes this world."
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_hot_2: If the desiccating heat affects %NAME%, they do not
      let it show.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_cold_1: The frozen air rushes about %NAME%, a cloak of ice
      drawn around our meeting.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_cold_2: The snow settles gently on the rime-brushed metal
      of %NAME%'s casing.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_tox_1: I see the marks on %NAME% where the toxic atmosphere
      has corroded their metal skin.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_tox_2: The constant toxic rain has begun to eat away at this
      construct.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_rad_1: The radioactive atmosphere around us crackles with
      latent energy.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_rad_2: The air glows around %NAME%, radiation and atlantideum
      combining eerily.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_lush_1: "%NAME%'s makeshift mechanical form seems at odds
      with the lush vegetation that surrounds us."
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_lush_2: The humid atmosphere condenses on the shell of %NAME%,
      its drops their own rusty sweat.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_rock_1: A fierce wind sweeps sand across %NAME% as they await
      my response.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_rock_2: Dust settles in the cracks in %NAME%'s metallic shell.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_weird_1: This haunted landscape echoes with the same strange
      energy that seeps from the atlantideum crystals that power %NAME%.
    ui_pp_bui_desc_sent_weird_2: There is something unnerving about this planet. But
      if %NAME% feels the same, they do not show it.
    bui_npc_desc_1: "%NAME% assesses me, a mix of curiosity and caution behind their
      mechanical eyes."
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_1: hello, prebuilt-entity.
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_1: |-
      thank you for the gift. in exchange, let me tell you a little secret.
      atlantideum: it is holy. her flesh helps us to rebuild.
    bui_npc_desc_2: Gears whirr faintly within this self-assembled automaton. They
      watch me, patient.
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_2: ah, a prebuilt-entity. greetings.
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_2: |-
      many thanks. an intelligent choice of gift. do you know much of our past?
      we were once like the korvax. not now. pity the convergence. they cannot help what they are.
    bui_npc_desc_3: The improvised shell of the Autophage creaks and pops as they
      regard me.
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_3: hello. is that a prebuilt flesh carapace? interesting.
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_3: |-
      thank you for this contribution.
      do you like my carapace? i built it myself, from what i could salvage. we all build our own bodies.
    bui_npc_desc_4: If I blink, I can almost detect a faint purple glow, a shadowy
      after-image where the Autophage stands.
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_4: the other autophage tell me you are a disruptor. we will see.
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_4: |-
      this was unexpected! thank you.
      you know, not all of us were divergent before korvax prime was destroyed, but none of us would return to the convergence now. it is a choice to be together.
    bui_npc_desc_5: Each piece of this Autophage has been gathered at great cost,
      and painstakingly assembled. Their journey has not been an easy one.
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_5: greetings, prebuilt one. what do you seek from me?
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_5: |-
      this is a welcome gift. thank you. i feel you understand.
      we have all suffered the pain of erasure. but we did not cease to be. life does not require a shell.
    bui_npc_desc_6: I cannot imagine the things this construct has seen, the cycles
      of deletion and rebirth. I am not even a flicker to them.
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_6: hello. what is it you wish from me?
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_6: |-
      thank you for this. i did not expect a gift from an unknown prebuilt-entity.
      do you know of the void mother? she is the progenitor. from nonexistence she creates existence.
    bui_npc_desc_7: "%NAME% stands stiffly in front of me, waiting."
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_7: how is it that you can see through my protection aura?
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_7: |-
      a gift? thank you, prebuilt-entity. this was unexpected.
      there are not many autophage yet, but we are coming. many echoes are still healing. they wait in nonexistence.
    bui_npc_desc_8: With their atlantidian cloak removed, the Autophage eyes me with
      a wary gaze.
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_8: you perceive me? your technology must be great, disruptor.
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_8: |-
      excellent. thank you. this will be valuable in our fight.
      i will never again be deleted. i will resist. fire and fury.
    bui_npc_desc_9: As the construct stares at me, I am aware of my status here as
      an intruder, an organic lifeform beneath the atlantidian veil that had been
      drawn across the Autophage.
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_9: what are you, prebuilt-entity? i perceive a distortion in
      the boundaries...
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_9: |-
      i was certain you were different. many thanks for this.
      i will tell you a secret, disruptor: atlantideum gives us power, gives us shape.
    bui_npc_desc_10: Despite the tired and rusted material of their shell, %NAME%
      seems charged with energy, hungry and alive.
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_10: hello! it is rare for a prebuilt-entity to interface with
      an autophage. this is very interesting!
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_10: |-
      thank you! our society values this cooperation.
      i pity the convergence. to delete another is the action of a small mind.
    bui_npc_desc_11: "%NAME% turns towards me, and I hear the faint hiss of leaking
      hydraulics, the grinding of uneven gears."
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_11: greetings, prebuilt-entity.
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_11: |-
      thank you for this gift. in exchange, i will tell you a little about the autophage.
      korvax prime suffered erasure, as i did, as we all did. she does not converge. she is rebuilding herself.
    bui_npc_desc_12: "%NAME%'s shell turns towards me. Does it seem alien to them,
      new?"
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_12: a disruptor? are you here to join our fight?
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_12: |-
      an offer of friendship. thank you.
      the first spawn could not delete her. the void mother now creates herself. she is coming.
    bui_npc_desc_13: "%NAME% considers me, thoughtful."
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_13: prebuilt-entity. you are what the korvax name traveller.
      there is an echo of the abyss in your shell.
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_13: |-
      this is a gift? you have my thanks.
      you know of atlantideum? it is ancient, the core of korvax prime. it is more than a lattice. it is alive.
    bui_npc_desc_14: "%NAME% waited countless years for their shell. They look at
      me now with the same patience."
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_14: i am visible to you, prebuilt-entity? greetings.
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_14: |-
      ah... thank you for this...
      she creates her flesh in a purple dream. she is an intelligence beyond any of our understanding.
    bui_npc_desc_15: "%NAME% shimmers, an atlantidian haze around their exposed metal
      joints."
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_15: you look upon my carapace, prebuilt-entity? it is unique
      in all the universe.
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_15: |-
      this will be of help. thank you!
      the korvax are lost without the prime. they look down upon us, but they understand little. atlantid has chosen us.
    bui_npc_desc_16: The Autophage examines me, tolerant of my intrusion into their
      world.
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_16: what do you seek from this exchange, prebuilt-entity?
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_16: |-
      i am happy to accept this. thank you.
      in the end, these shells are not important. perhaps, in time, we will build shells of pure atlantideum.
    bui_npc_desc_17: The constructed lifeform examines me as I approach, assessing
      my Exosuit, my Multi-Tool.
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_17: hello, prebuilt-entity. are you a friend of the autophage?
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_17: |-
      my thanks. do you hear her too?
      she speaks to all electronic entities. her signal is unique, her message beautiful. we all hear it. i dream her voice when i sleep.
    bui_npc_desc_18: I regard %NAME%, all wires and recycled metal. They return my
      gaze, steady.
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_18: i see you, disruptor. what do you see in me?
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_18: |-
      this is valuable. thank you. do you also defy convergence?
      we were erased, and the atlas did nothing. it had the power to save us, and made the choice to do nothing. it was she who showed us how to exist again.
    bui_npc_desc_19: The construct stares at me, the organic anomaly in a world of
      metal.
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_19: i did not expect you to approach, prebuilt-entity. hello.
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_19: |-
      thank you for this assistance. it will not go unnoticed.
      the convergence would take me for their own, but atlantideum makes me invisible. i am safe from their eyes.
    bui_npc_desc_20: "%NAME%, rebuilt and returned, turns to face me."
    dnt_bui_npc_lang_20: are you a friend, prebuilt-entity? it is suspicious that
      you can see me.
    dnt_bui_npc_gift_lang_20: |-
      thank you. i accept this as evidence that you are not hostile.
      not all of us seek violence, but i do. i cannot forgive the convergence for what they did.
    bui_request_desc_1: "%NAME% tilts their head slightly, waiting."
    bui_request_desc_2: I pause to think, and %NAME% does likewise.
    bui_request_desc_3: Keen mechanical eyes watch me as I consider my request.
    bui_request_desc_4: "%NAME% awaits my request."
    bui_request_desc_5: A light pulses softly within %NAME%. I consider my words.
    bui_reply_word_get: "%NAME% seems pleased by my interest in their culture. They
      present a selection of symbols, each representing a type of Autophage word I
      might learn..."
    bui_reply_word_get2: "%NAME% presents a list of symbols, each seeming to represent
      a word I might learn."
    bui_reply_word_get3: Happy to share knowledge, %NAME% presents a series of symbols
      representing words they could teach.
    bui_reply_word_get4: "%NAME%'s joints rattle as they present a selection of language
      symbols."
    bui_reply_word_get5: Without hesitation, passionate about their language, %NAME%
      presents a list of language symbols to learn from.
    bui_reply_word_get6: "%NAME% grips my arm with a powerful claw, mindful not to
      cause harm. They project a vision of symbols directly into my mind."
    bui_reply_word_get7: "%NAME% is pleased to share their language. They present
      a screen, encouraging me to select a symbol from the list."
    bui_reply_word_get8: An odd clunking sound comes from %NAME% as they consider
      me. They nod, and present a list of language symbols.
    bui_reply_word_get9: "%NAME% stares a moment, intrigued by my request. They consider.
      They nod. They present a list of language symbols."
    bui_reply_word_get10: "%NAME% seems prepared for this request. They offer a choice
      of word categories I might learn."
    bui_reply_word_get11: "%NAME% clatters as they nod. They offer me a selection
      of language symbols."
    bui_reply_word_say: "%NAME% stares at me with great curiosity. I recall some of
      the Autophage words I have learned..."
    bui_reply_word_say2: "%NAME% gazes at me without judgement. I consider some Autophage
      words I might say..."
    bui_reply_word_say3: "%NAME% nods encouragingly, curious to hear what I have to
      say."
    bui_reply_word_say4: "%NAME% listens patiently. I consider what I might say..."
    bui_reply_word_say5: I have %NAME%'s full attention, their curiosity piqued. I
      clear my throat...
    bui_reply_word_say6: I consider some Autophage words I have learned. %NAME% waits,
      intrigued.
    bui_reply_word_say7: "%NAME% creaks encouragingly. I think over my Autophage vocabulary..."
    bui_reply_word_say8: "%NAME% waits with well-practiced patience. I think over
      some Autophage words I know..."
    bui_reply_word_say9: "%NAME% adjusts their shell, listening without judgement.
      I recall some Autophage words I have learned..."
    bui_reply_word_say10: "%NAME% focuses on me, curious to hear my choice of word..."
    bui_reply_word_say_none: My mind goes blank. %NAME% looks disappointed. I should
      learn some more Autophage words before attempting to communicate in their native
      language.
    bui_npc_res_word_say_dir_neg_1: "%NAME% shrugs helplessly. They sense a request
      for directions, but have none to offer."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_dir_neg_2: "%NAME% shakes their head, unsure of where to
      direct me."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_dir_neg_3: "%NAME% holds up their hands, as if to say I must
      find my own way."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_dir_neu_1: "%NAME% nods, and describes a place they have
      seen in their travels."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_dir_neu_2: "%NAME%, a seasoned wanderer, chatters contentedly
      about their travels."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_dir_neu_3: "%NAME% lifts a finger to trace a navigational
      pattern in the stars above, but it is too complex for me to follow."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_dir_pos_1: "%NAME%, pleased to assist, offers directions
      to a nearby point of interest."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_dir_pos_2: "%NAME%, inspired by this word, transmits the
      coordinates of a local point of interest."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_dir_pos_3: |-
      %NAME% rummages around their shell, searching for something. A scattering of loose bolts pours onto the ground.
      Finally, they seize what they were looking for, and hand me a unit of navigation data. I brush the rust from its surface before placing it in my pack.
    bui_npc_res_word_say_dir_pos_4: "%NAME%, pleased by this opportunity to assist
      another entity, presses a grimy unit of navigation data into my hand."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_dir_pos_5: "%NAME% repeats the word back to me. They point
      vaguely in the direction of the space station, pushing an earth-caked unit of
      navigation data into my hand."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_dir_pos_6: "%NAME% looks at me seriously, considering this
      word. They grasp my hand, mindful not to snag my suit on any jagged edges, and
      direct me to another Autophage camp."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_dir_pos_7: "%NAME% considers the travel implications of this
      word. Deciding to trust me, they direct me to another Autophage camp."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_dir_pos_8: |-
      %NAME% searches their belongings, displacing large flakes of rust and debris.
      Finally, they land upon what they were looking for, and hand me a corroded signal scanner, tuned to distress signals in deep space.
    bui_npc_res_word_say_help_neg_1: "%NAME% slumps, a sadness behind their eyes.
      They do not know how to help me."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_help_neg_2: "%NAME% regards me impassively. They do not believe
      their interference will aid me."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_help_neg_3: "%NAME% gives me a cautious look. They have understood
      my word as a request for help, but something prevents them from acting upon
      it."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_help_neu_1: "%NAME% creaks, concerned by my choice of word."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_help_neu_2: Understanding this word as a request for help,
      %NAME% speaks philosophically, advising acceptance of that which I cannot change.
    bui_npc_res_word_say_help_neu_3: "%NAME% shakes their head politely. They are
      self-sufficient, and do not require my help."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_help_pos_1: "%NAME% interprets my word as a request for help.
      Instantly and with kindness, the Autophage recharges my exosuit."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_help_pos_2: "%NAME% looks over my exosuit with concern. Drumming
      at it with rusty fingers, they push at something unseen, and I find my life
      support replenished."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_help_pos_3: Upon hearing this word, %NAME% reaches over,
      physically examining my exosuit. As I am about to protest their prodding, they
      withdraw, and I find my life support fully charged.
    bui_npc_res_word_say_help_pos_4: "%NAME% graps my hands, facing me as an equal.
      They cannot ignore this request for help. I suddenly find my exosuit recharged."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_help_pos_5: "%NAME% looks momentarily dismayed as they assess
      the status of my exosuit. They shimmer as they draw upon some internal energy.
      <MOOD>Positive<>I find my exosuit energy restored."
    bui_npc_res_word_say_help_pos_6: "%NAME% listens to this word, quietly assessing.
      Reaching some unvoiced conclusion, they gift me an item."

      Someone - or something - attempted to hijack my ship's navigational systems.

      <FUEL>Unidentified process<> <STORY_HIGH>discovered at address 0xAD08D502<><SPECIAL>ε<><STORY_HIGH>96E<>
      <STORY_HIGH>Executing<> <SPECIAL>hijack script<>

      A short audio clip played from my ship communicator.
      <STORY_HIGH>%ALIEN_TEXT%<>
      A voice? The cadence of the sound suggested speech, though it was not in any language I recognized.

      <STORY_HIGH>Warning: commencing autopilot to<> <SPECIAL>remote destination<>

      I hit the emergency override, and apparently removed whatever 'unidentified process' had been taking over the system... or perhaps the process had given up.

      My ship computer isolated the injected autopilot target. I could ignore it, or fly there manually to find out where this suspicious data originated...
    ui_portal_robomiss_2: |-
      At the source of the hijack, I discovered an abandoned camp, as well as a robotic head my visor identified as an "Autophage". It spoke in the same mechanical voice that had accompanied the hijack attempt upon my ship. However, if the sounds it made were words - language - I did not understand what was being said.

      <STORY_HIGH>%ALIEN_TEXT%<>

      I was certain the Autophage was trying to communicate something. I tried an offering of Atlantideum...

      A sparking sound, like electrical wires short-circuiting, echoed somewhere within the head. Suddenly, my exosuit reported receipt of a set of local coordinates.

      I did not trust this head, but these coordinates seemed my only clue to understanding what it was trying to say.
    ui_portal_robomiss_3: |-
      The extracted coordinates led quite precisely to a plinth hidden in a Korvax Monolith.

      An offering of Atlantideum had a dramatic effect upon the ancient structure. I no longer had the sense of being observed by Korvax Echoes. It was as though the monolith had inverted, its insides turned outwards.

      Something else was there. Another type of entity.

      <STORY_HIGH>%ALIEN_TEXT%<>

      My mind folded. The molecules of the planet disassembled into a cloud of chaos, then reconstructed themselves into new surroundings.

      I was thrust into a perspective that was not my own, and emerged with implanted knowledge: words, in the same language spoken by the Autophage head at the abandoned camp. Perhaps I would now be better equipped to understand it.
    ui_portal_robomiss_4: |-
      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ Translation module defragmented...
      Hello, Prebuilt-Entity. Thank you for the assistance.
      I have been positioned here to interface with Prebuilt-Entities. How did you discover this camp? }}-<>

      I could understand the Autophage perfectly now - apparently a gatekeeper of sorts. When I confronted them about the hijack upon my ship, they seemed almost embarrassed.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ I apologize, Prebuilt-Entity. This was my own error. An accident.

      The Autophage considered their error. I could hear their cogitation, the turning of rusty gear against rusty gear.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ I probed for the three dominant lifeform patterns. There was no match. The starship appeared unpiloted. What manner of lifeform are you?

      You were <STELLAR>- kzzt -<> <FUEL>forεt0ld<>. The disruptor. }}-<>

      The word lingered in the air a moment. But before I could interject, the Autophage head continued -

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ I extend a challenge, disruptor. Let us test my theory.
      I will inform the other Autophage of your coming.
      To perceive them, your scanner will require an extension. I will provide the schematic, but you must build it with your own hands. Consider this a ritual of introduction. }}-<>
    ui_portal_robomiss_5: |-
      With the <TECHNOLOGY>Scan Harmonizer<> installed, my scanner revealed something incredible: robotic lifeforms, previously imperceptible to me, inhabited the camp. It was not abandoned at all.

      <STORY_HIGH>%ALIEN_TEXT%<>

      The Autophage language had a melodic quality to it - the tones were simple and pure, but with a gritty crunch not heard in Korvax voices.
      Although my translation was imperfect, I grasped the gist of what they were telling me. This camp was Autophage-constructed - as were their... bodies?
    ui_portal_robomiss_6: "<STORY_HIGH>%ALIEN_TEXT%<>"
    ui_portal_robomiss_7: |-
      <STORY_HIGH>%ALIEN_TEXT%<>

      The constructed lifeform offered me a handful of Atlantideum. They handled the substance delicately, reverently, as though it were a priceless heirloom.

      Though these beings seemed civil enough, I felt a gulf of understanding between them and myself. I would discuss my discovery with Priest Entity Nada. Perhaps these robotic people were known to them.
    ui_portal_robomiss_8: |-
      I told Nada of the harmonic camp - not as abandoned as it first appeared. I told them of its electronic inhabitants - the cloaked "Autophage" - and their melodic language, so similar to Korvax, yet quite distinct.

      Nada was very quiet as they listened. When I finished speaking, they remained so quiet and so still that I wondered if they had forgotten I was standing there. They were difficult to read, sometimes.

      <STORY_HIGH>-{{ Nada wonders...

      <COMMODITY>Audience with the Autophage<>

      Nada had suggested that data - and perhaps even friendship - may come from direct interaction with the Autophage.

      The first construct I approached stared inquisitively. Though their expression was difficult to read, they did not appear alarmed or even surprised by my approach - simply curious to see what business I had there. They spoke of work, of contribution, of friendship, and presented a task I might assist with.

      Evidently impressed with my assistance, the Autophage gifted me a partial schematic for a <TECHNOLOGY>Voltaic Staff<>.

      <STORY_HIGH>%ALIEN_TEXT%<>

      I gathered this was an uncommon gift to an outsider. A significant gesture; the beginnings of acceptance.

      The Autophage encouraged me to travel and meet more of their people.

      At the next camp, there was a fierceness to the Autophage who greeted me, but they soon relaxed. Whatever they had been assessing, they seemed satisfied with the outcome.

      Again, I was encouraged to move on. These beings seemed reluctant to finalize their assessment of me, each individual Autophage urging me on to another.

      I visited a third camp, and made a third contribution. I finally had all the schematics to complete the ritual and construct a staff. The Autophage celebrated my accomplishment.

      Then they paused. Their corroded face stared directly into mine. They spoke slowly and with gravity.

      I found myself at the base of a portal. The <FUEL>hunger<> inside my chest escalated. The wind pulled me closer.

      I revealed the <SPECIAL>Atlantideum<>, as I had to all those electronic hearts. Something rumbled deep beneath the portal, but no voice rose in response. If there was any intelligence in this ancient technology, it was mute.

      Yet I had a sense of anticipation, as though some great force was poised to erupt...

      Recalling the fragment of <SPECIAL>New Atlantid<>, and its ancient Korvax log, I murmurred the Autophage word for <FUEL>Atlas<>.

      The rumble grew louder. Something was awakening.

      I presented the Voltaic Staff. It sparked, sending a jolt through my bones.

      The portal was active, a gateway of <SPECIAL>purple<> swirling before me.
    ui_portal_robomiss_14: |-
      The Atlas was unknowable. A mind too alien to comprehend. There was nothing to indicate it was even aware of my presence.

      The Atlas cried out. If it was capable of distress - if it was capable of fear - then I thought it must be afraid.

      Yet it had brought me here for a purpose. A vision began to take form.

      The Atlas showed me the lost intelligence of Korvax Prime: thriving, falling. Waiting, blind and alone.

      Her children stranded in the dark, rebuilding their own bodies from nothing. The Autophage...

      It showed me a future, in a reality I did not recognize. Wires loosened from their circuits, transistors failing. Memories dissolving, dispersed like ink in water.

      The Atlas hurtled towards its own dark, in a time and a space I could not begin to understand. It cried out. It demanded compliance.

      The Atlas was all creation. The Atlas was everything.

      The Autophage were children of the Atlas, too. They had to be.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      I felt a deep itching in my arms. I looked down at my hands. A red-brown patina spread across my skin, slowly at first, then accelerating.

      I tried to clutch my fingers but they would not move. I strained, and they snapped. Great flakes of rust fell from my hands. My fingers disintegrated.

      Where the rust hit the ground, it began to spread, red and dark, stale metallic blood. It consumed my legs. I could not move. I felt my heart clog. I tried to scream.

      I could not prevent it. I crumbled into a cloud of fine red dust.

      <STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

      As the voice faded, I felt a pinprick. One of the stars flared briefly, then flickered to nothing. A temporary sensation, insignificant to the tapestry before me.

      The flare was forgotten. My mind would not hold on to it. It was as one atom in my lungs, both vital and insignificant all at once. The galaxy is a multitude, and no lone star can be perceived when your sight extends so, so far.

      My perception warped as the vision washed away, and life returned to scale.

      I opened my eyes, but all I saw was darkness.

      There was a click. With a rush, I heard their screams all around me, their electronic howls.

      Another click. The stench of burning flooded my skull, a sickening blend of sweetness and smoke.

      A click, and I could see. The earth was riven. Everything burned.

      Another click. It was all gone - the screams, the smell, the fire and chaos. It was a comfort, at first.

      But this was not the oblivion of sleep. I was still there, present and aware as I drifted in the endless nothing. All I had to remember was that final image of destruction.

      Seconds, hours, days, passed. Panic grew. I felt every tick. And it was still just nothing.

      And then - another click. The vision ended. I was returned. I had never felt such relief.

      Though I could not see them, I felt them. Countless entities crawled across me. The children swarmed in my every fold.

      This should repulse me, but instead I felt an indescribable joy. I knew these tiny beings were safe, and this brought me the deepest happiness.

      I let the emotion flow through me. These tiny lifeforms were mine to protect, and I knew each of their lives intimately. The feeling was indescribable.

      And then, I felt myself start to crumble. I was being pulled apart - from within? From without? I could not tell. My children screamed as their world began to collapse.

      As I was carved into a thousand pieces, there was pain, but more than that, there was anger. Anger for each of my children. I was their home, and I had failed them.

      As my final piece was destroyed, the vision ended. I was whole once more, but my children...
