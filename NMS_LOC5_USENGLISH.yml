    ui_crea_desc_predator1_1: Predatory in habit, they stalk their prey with a great
      degree of care.
    ui_crea_desc_predator1_2: A vicious predator, they take great care as they hunt
      down their prey.
    ui_crea_desc_predator1_3: A natural predator, they stalk their prey with great
      care.
    ui_crea_desc_predator1_4: An intelligent predator, they hunt with skill and stealth.
    ui_crea_desc_predator1_5: A sharp intelligence flashes in their eyes. They are
      careful, methodical hunters.
    ui_crea_desc_predator2_1: Patient by nature, they watch their prey carefully before
      striking, wasting no energy on failed hunts.
    ui_crea_desc_predator2_2: A well-regulated digestive system means they need only
      feed very occasionally. They are free to be patient in their search for prey.
    ui_crea_desc_predator2_3: Calm in spirit, they appear almost serene. This surface
      impression belies the cruelty latent in this vicious hunter.
    ui_crea_desc_predator2_4: A slow but relentless predator. Once they have begun
      their hunt there is little that will stop them.
    ui_crea_desc_predator2_5: A patient predator, they are willing to wait for days
      on end for the perfect moment to strike.
    ui_crea_desc_predator3_1: Nervous in habit, despite their predatory nature. They
      too are prey.
    ui_crea_desc_predator3_2: Cautious and deliberate, they skitter from hunt to hunt,
      always on the lookout for those who would steal their prey.
    ui_crea_desc_predator3_3: An unkind, jealous predator. They would sooner steal
      food from their own family than undertake a difficult hunt.
    ui_crea_desc_predator3_4: Always on the lookout, their cautious nature reflects
      the sudden and violent cruelty of their own crude 'society'.
    ui_crea_desc_predator3_5: Cautious by nature, they stalk their prey carefully.
      Once they have selected a target, this methodical hunter rarely fails to make
      a kill.
    ui_crea_desc_predator4_1: An impulsive hunter, they are quick to lash out at any
      creature unfortunate enough to wander into their territory.
    ui_crea_desc_predator4_2: Mindless and quick to rush into action, these predatory
      beasts have evolved fast-healing skin as a response to the frequent beatings
      they endure in poorly judged fights.
    ui_crea_desc_predator4_3: An ancient predator, its mind has evolved impulsive
      hunting instincts. With no higher brain function, they simply follow the aggressive
      impulses that flash across their synapses.
    ui_crea_desc_predator4_4: Impulsive and unpredictable, these vicious predators
      are as quick to pick a fight with their own kin as they are to hunt prey or
      attack a rival.
    ui_crea_desc_predator4_5: Predatory in habit, they choose their prey impulsively,
      lashing out with an unpredictable ferocity.
    ui_crea_desc_predator5_1: A vicious predator, they chase their prey with reckless
      abandon.
    ui_crea_desc_predator5_2: A reckless predator, they charge into fights, caring
      little for stealth or ambush.
    ui_crea_desc_predator5_3: A reckless predator, they happily hunt creatures far
      larger than themselves.
    ui_crea_desc_predator5_4: Adrenaline glands embedded throughout the dermal layer
      suppress this beast's awareness of pain.
    ui_crea_desc_predator5_5: Driven by blind fury, this predator is oblivious to
      all but their prey during a hunt.
    ui_crea_desc_predator6_1: An efficient hunter with high energy reserves. Deters
      other predators with untiring aggression.
    ui_crea_desc_predator6_2: Highly territorial, this predator continually marks
      their hunting grounds with scent. Pheromones are undetectable by herbivore species.
    ui_crea_desc_predator6_3: This species has a constantly shifting social structure,
      with dominance established by physical strength and aggression.
    ui_crea_desc_predator6_4: A crafty hunter, known to kill the young of competing
      species.
    ui_crea_desc_predator6_5: This predator will attack anything within proximity.
      Their sheer aggression intimidates prey and competitors alike.
    ui_crea_desc_predator7_1: This brain of this creature produces no stress-related
      hormones, resulting in a predator entirely uninhibited by fear.
    ui_crea_desc_predator7_2: A fearless, highly specialised hunter. Shortened neural
      pathways allow for near-instant cognitive processing, eliminating the need for
      base emotion.
    ui_crea_desc_predator7_3: A desperate, ravenous hunter. Inefficient energy processing
      means this creature is forever seeking their next meal, hunger overriding any
      sense of danger.
    ui_crea_desc_predator7_4: The flesh of these creatures is poisonous to most other
      species. They have no natural predators, and hunt totally unafraid.
    ui_crea_desc_predator7_5: This predator is naturally curious, and will eat most
      other species. An internal array of beak-like protrusions help digest unusual
      food.
    ui_crea_desc_predator8_1: This species lives communally in deep underground burrows,
      huddled to preserve warmth. They drag their prey deep into the earth before
      feeding.
    ui_crea_desc_predator8_2: This predator moves slowly and deliberately, preserving
      their energy for the hunt. They pursue their prey in short, intense sprints.
    ui_crea_desc_predator8_3: This creature has an especially slow digestive cycle,
      eating one meal a week and hibernating between hunts.
    ui_crea_desc_predator8_4: A cold-blooded killer, this creature will spend days
      hunting for an ideal target, ignoring the effects of starvation.
    ui_crea_desc_predator8_5: An endothermic predator, this creature maintains a low
      body temperature while resting. The scent of prey accelerates their metabolism,
      warming their blood for the hunt.
    ui_crea_desc_predator9_1: This predator will kill and often cannibalise their
      young, eliminating the weak. Only the hardiest creatures reach maturity, and
      are completely without fear.
    ui_crea_desc_predator9_2: Gripped by bloodlust during a hunt. Released from their
      frenzy only when their prey's heartbeat goes still.
    ui_crea_desc_predator9_3: This dangerous predator is alerted to their own injuries
      only by scent, and cannot feel pain.
    ui_crea_desc_predator9_4: Lacking a central nervous system, this primitive predator
      responds to stimuli by reflex only. They are barely conscious, and cannot feel
      fear.
    ui_crea_desc_predator9_5: This solo hunter is optimised for killing and eating.
      Their nervous system is focused purely on survival.
    ui_crea_desc_predator10_1: This predator studies their prey's behaviour from afar,
      determining points of weakness and calculating the best time to strike.
    ui_crea_desc_predator10_2: An oversized frontal lobe enables this predator to
      form elaborate plans of attack, ensnaring their prey with cunning rather than
      force.
    ui_crea_desc_predator10_3: This predator fashions tools from their environment,
      conserving energy by automating their hunting process where possible.
    ui_crea_desc_predator10_4: These predators collaborate to attack in groups, communicating
      via a sophisticated combination of scents and vibrations.
    ui_crea_desc_predator10_5: Mostly nocturnal, this predator memorises complex mental
      maps of their territory, anticipating the likely paths their prey might take.
    ui_crea_desc_predator11_1: Secure in their own strength, this predator often appears
      calm and docile. They will only snap into action when provoked, or hungry.
    ui_crea_desc_predator11_2: An accomplished hunter, this creature attacks effortlessly,
      almost lazily.
    ui_crea_desc_predator11_3: This predator dominates any region they choose to occupy.
      They enjoy a relaxed, unchallenged existence.
    ui_crea_desc_predator11_4: Unthreatened for generations, this predator no longer
      produces anxiety hormones. They are driven to hunt only when hungry.
    ui_crea_desc_predator11_5: Unusual adrenal glands allow this creature to metabolise
      steroid hormones more efficiently, reducing impact on cognition and resulting
      in an exceptionally calm killer.
    ui_crea_desc_predator12_1: A vicious killer, there is a spark of malice lurking
      behind its cold, intelligent eyes.
    ui_crea_desc_predator12_2: A dangerous hunter, their sense organs appear to swell
      as they detect the stress hormones of their prey.
    ui_crea_desc_predator12_3: A clever and ruthless predator, they frequently make
      a kill and leave the carcass uneaten, as if hunting purely for pleasure.
    ui_crea_desc_predator12_4: By day, this is a calm and efficient predator. But
      at night they appear prone to fits of bloodlust, striking out even when not
      hungry.
    ui_crea_desc_predator12_5: Highly intelligent, this calm and methodical hunter
      shows no signs of empathy to accompany its complex problem solving skills.
    ui_crea_desc_predator13_1: Bold in temperament, this predator is unafraid of even
      the largest prey.
    ui_crea_desc_predator13_2: This predator appears to have evolved in symbiosis
      with a brain parasite that encourages it to take large risks while hunting.
    ui_crea_desc_predator13_3: Bold in their habits, competition with their rivals
      frequently drives them to engage in high-risk hunting behaviour.
    ui_crea_desc_predator13_4: A foolhardy beast, it rampages towards its prey without
      caution or subtlety.
    ui_crea_desc_predator13_5: Relentless in its hunt, it charges ahead, paying scant
      regard to the threats or counterattacks of its victims.
    ui_crea_desc_predator14_1: Methodical and patient, they stalk their prey for hours
      on end, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.
    ui_crea_desc_predator14_2: A careful hunter, they stalk their prey along long-distance
      migration routes. The weak are picked off as the journey wears them down.
    ui_crea_desc_predator14_3: A patient hunter, their highly evolved sense organs
      allow them to detect prey at extreme distances.
    ui_crea_desc_predator14_4: They have evolved the ability to sleep while moving,
      allowing them to hunt their prey over colossal distances.
    ui_crea_desc_predator14_5: Intelligent, calm, and methodical, this relentless
      hunter stalks their prey to the point of exhaustion.
    ui_crea_desc_predator15_1: Jerky and unbalanced in its movements, its unusual
      brain chemistry leaves it prone to sudden outbursts of aggression.
    ui_crea_desc_playerpred1_1: This dangerous beast has sensitive magnetoreceptors
      embedded in their nostrils, evolved to detect and hunt down anomalous lifeforms.
    ui_crea_desc_playerpred1_2: A lethal predator, this creature reuptakes all inhibitory
      neurotransmitters when stalking a chosen target.
    ui_crea_desc_playerpred1_3: This creature's fine muscle control allows it to track
      its prey completely silently.
    ui_crea_desc_playerpred1_4: An indiscriminate killer, this creature will rarely
      disengage from a conflict while its opponent still lives.
    ui_crea_desc_playerpred1_5: Soon after birth, they fight to the death with their
      siblings; only the strongest and most vicious survive infancy.
    ui_crea_desc_playerpred2_1: Soon after birth, they fight to the death with their
      siblings; only the strongest and most vicious survive infancy.
    ui_crea_desc_playerpred3_1: A vicious beast, it attracts a mate by creating a
      grisly display from the bones of its prey.
    ui_crea_desc_playerpred4_1: A cruel and dangerous predator, it has evolved a remarkably
      muscular jaw. It occasionally crushes even its own teeth.
    ui_crea_desc_playerpred5_1: Sense organs appear unusually undeveloped for an apex
      predator. It seems to compensate by lashing out with extreme and indiscriminate
      violence.
    ui_crea_desc_playerpred6_1: Exceptionally strong, they appear to take delight
      in dismembering their prey. Is this emotion an illusion, or a sign of deeper
      intelligence?
    ui_crea_desc_playerpred7_1: They appear to possess some sort of genetic or collective
      memory, harbouring deep grudges against species that wronged them in the distance
      past.
    ui_crea_desc_playerpred8_1: A dangerous predator, their fast-response adrenal
      glands allow them to go from rest to rage in mere moments.
    ui_crea_desc_playerpred9_1: A highly territorial predator, their excellent memory
      and long-range vision allow them to hunt across vast distances.
    ui_crea_desc_playerpred10_1: A tireless predator, they have no natural enemies.
      Their ferocity knows no bounds.
    ui_crea_desc_passive1_1: Their search for food drags them far and wide across
      the planet, their journey never ending.
    ui_crea_desc_passive1_2: Their natural high stamina serves them well as they wander,
      walking countless miles in their search for food and shelter.
    ui_crea_desc_passive1_3: Remarkably high endurance means they rarely stop moving,
      able to gaze endlessly as they migrate across the planet.
    ui_crea_desc_passive1_4: Migratory in nature, their seasonal wanders take them
      from one pole to the other, moving as the light levels change.
    ui_crea_desc_passive1_5: Their search for a mate takes them countless miles across
      the planet's surface, an arduous and long-distance journey for love.
    ui_crea_desc_passive2_1: Tough, hardy wanderers, they spend their lives on the
      move. Their existence is a constant, slow-moving race against predators and
      starvation.
    ui_crea_desc_passive2_2: Drawn by magnetic forces on long journeys across the
      planet, their lives are spent in constant motion.
    ui_crea_desc_passive2_3: Always on the move, these nomadic grazers search far
      and wide for the perfect grazing sites.
    ui_crea_desc_passive2_4: Weaker than their appearance suggests, they make up for
      the many who die on their nomadic wanderings with frequent and rapid breeding.
    ui_crea_desc_passive2_5: Their soul responds to some rhythm deep within the planet's
      core, causing them to wander endlessly to its slow marching beat.
    ui_crea_desc_passive3_1: Possessing a calm intelligence, their piercing eyes never
      forget a face.
    ui_crea_desc_passive3_2: A remarkable fusion between their optic nerve and hippocampus
      means visual data is instantaneously and perfectly stored. An adaptation for
      navigation, perhaps. But it ensures they will never forget you.
    ui_crea_desc_passive3_3: Highly social and with a complex herd hierarchy, their
      remarkable memory ensures they never forget the face of another creature, be
      they friend or foe.
    ui_crea_desc_passive3_4: Highly intelligent, they remember every encounter they
      ever have with another species.
    ui_crea_desc_passive3_5: A higher order intelligence lives within its skull. The
      analysis process reveals an eidetic memory, though some brain functions appear
      resistant to the scanner.
    ui_crea_desc_passive4_1: Submissive without being timid, these gentle creatures
      know no fear, only curiosity.
    ui_crea_desc_passive4_2: Gentle animals at heart, they wish only to be left in
      peace to roam.
    ui_crea_desc_passive4_3: Powerful but submissive, they have evolved to avoid confrontation.
    ui_crea_desc_passive4_4: Yielding quickly in direct confrontation, their non-threatening
      nature is a successful counter-strategy in an aggressive world.
    ui_crea_desc_passive4_5: Submissive and gentle in their relationships with one
      another, they nonetheless respond forcefully when threatened by other creatures.
    ui_crea_desc_passive5_1: Unusually intelligent, they are highly perceptive of
      their sensory environment, reacting to patterns and signal beyond the observation
      of most species.
    ui_crea_desc_passive5_2: Scans reveal an unusual 'double brain' structure, where
      extra lobes run in parallel and increase decision making speed.
    ui_crea_desc_passive5_3: High growth hormone levels in their brains have caused
      an unusually dense neuron structure. What this extra neural power is used for
      is unclear.
    ui_crea_desc_passive5_4: Scans reveal small neural clusters growing all over their
      nervous system, creating a highly complex distributed brain network.
    ui_crea_desc_passive5_5: Brain scans reveal unusually developed language centers
      within the supramarginal gyrus. The method by which they use this power is unclear.
    ui_crea_desc_passive6_1: Gentle, passive creatures. Dull and unintelligent in
      attitude, they are nonetheless content and unworried.
    ui_crea_desc_passive6_2: Poor sensory systems leave this typically passive creature
      unable to perceive much of the external world. However, brain scans reveal a
      deep, rich inner life.
    ui_crea_desc_passive6_3: Brain scans reveal unusually structured hypothalamus.
      It appears they perceive time on a different scale to most life, leading to
      their unflustered, passive temperament.
    ui_crea_desc_passive6_4: Passive, they are happy to ignore most animal life unless
      forced by circumstance to pay attention.
    ui_crea_desc_passive6_5: Slow moving, passive creatures, they are content to focus
      only on plantlife.
    ui_crea_desc_passive7_1: Friendly and curious by nature, they will take a keen
      interest in any new lifeforms they encounter.
    ui_crea_desc_passive7_2: Gentle creatures, they are governed by a friendly and
      highly trusting temperament.
    ui_crea_desc_passive7_3: Scans reveal them to be highly intelligent. However,
      they are easily tamed and appear content to follow the whims of other creatures.
    ui_crea_desc_passive7_4: Highly docile. This behavior appears to be instinctive,
      as if they have evolved to serve the whims of a complex herding predator.
    ui_crea_desc_passive7_5: Brain scans are unable to capture the true essence of
      their simple happiness.
    ui_crea_desc_passive8_1: Possessed of a tremendous natural strength, they fear
      no other creature that walks upon this world.
    ui_crea_desc_passive9_1: Long-lived and gentle, their rich lives and complex society
      hierarchy allow them to develop wisdom that rivals technologically advanced
      species.
    ui_crea_desc_passive10_1: Cautious by nature. Even when facing starvation, they
      do all they can to avoid straying into unknown territory.
    ui_crea_desc_passive11_1: Long lives and a deep genetic memory give them an uncanny
      ability to predict future events. No famine or drought ever catches them by
      surprise.
    ui_crea_desc_passive12_1: Flighty, busy creatures, they are always on the move,
      always foraging for their next meal.
    ui_crea_desc_passive13_1: Calm and methodical creatures, they graze the planet
      with an air of gentle, unflustered serenity.
    ui_crea_desc_passive14_1: Gentle, friendly creatures, they are always happy to
      interact with other living beings.
    ui_crea_desc_passive15_1: They interact with their fellow beasts with a cheerful
      confidence, secure in the hierarchy of the herd.
    ui_crea_desc_passive16_1: Social animals, they show great care in tending to their
      young and their sick.
    ui_crea_desc_passive17_1: They appear to be peaceful creatures, happily socialising
      both within their species and without.
    ui_crea_desc_prey1_1: They are cautious, watchful creatures; their sharp eyes
      always pointed to the horizon.
    ui_crea_desc_prey2_1: Nervous and flighty, these creatures exist in a constant
      state of nervous excitement, ready to flee at the first sign of danger.
    ui_crea_desc_prey3_1: Tense and easily startled, these creatures show a heightened
      sense of fear; they are alert to danger with every step.
    ui_crea_desc_prey4_1: Gentle creatures, though timid. They are reluctant to approach
      strangers, but display complex social behaviours within their herd.
    ui_crea_desc_prey5_1: They are shy creatures, cowed by years of constant predation
      by more aggressive beasts.
    ui_crea_desc_prey6_1: They seem aware of the constant danger in which they live,
      always scanning the horizon for new threats.
    ui_crea_desc_prey7_1: Patient and slow, they nibble and graze in perpetuity as
      they loll across the plains.
    ui_crea_desc_prey8_1: Once secure in a territory, they appear to tend to local
      plantlife, bolstering their own food supply.
    ui_crea_desc_prey9_1: Gregarious, wide-roaming creatures. They are occasionally
      found alone, but such animals are unhappy, lost from their herd.
    ui_crea_desc_prey10_1: They display an uneasy caution in the face of novelty,
      untrusting of strangers and strange situations.
    ui_crea_desc_prey11_1: Their muscles are held in a state of constant tension,
      ready to flee at the smallest sign of danger.
    ui_crea_desc_prey12_1: Collaborative herd animals, they work together to spot
      incoming predators, hundreds of eyes scanning the horizon in unison.
    ui_crea_desc_prey13_1: Bumbling and inattentive, they frequently find themselves
      trapped by both geological hazards and local predators.
    ui_crea_desc_prey14_1: Nomadic in habit, their search for food takes them on a
      never-ending journey across this world.
    ui_crea_desc_prey15_1: Quick, darting eyes reveal their nervous habit; they are
      quick to make decisions and even quicker to take flight.
    ui_crea_desc_prey16_1: Their movements are fidgety, darting this way and that
      in their desperation to eat but not be eaten.
    ui_crea_desc_prey17_1: Their lives seem spent in constant anxiety; they are tense
      and fearful even on a genetic level.
    ui_crea_desc_bird1_1: Fluttery and flighty, this creature spends its life airborne,
      too afraid to ever set down on land.
    ui_crea_desc_bird1_2: Once they emerge from the nest, they never again touch the
      ground. Their lives are spent on the wing, their stamina unrivalled.
    ui_crea_desc_bird2_1: Curious and intelligent, their nests are stuffed with brightly
      colored rocks and slivers of metal. Some build elaborate metal structures, showing
      remarkable artistry.
    ui_crea_desc_bird3_1: Steadfast, with a strong sense of place, they pick a roost
      and will not abandon their home unless facing certain death.
    ui_crea_desc_bird3_2: Once they have selected a nesting site, they remain there
      for the rest of their lives. As they continuously build, the nests of a mature
      adult are frequently colossal.
    ui_crea_desc_bird4_1: Powerful lateral muscles allow them to take off with remarkable
      speed, taking to the air faster than any ground predator could possibly lunge.
    ui_crea_desc_bird5_1: Long-distance fliers, their migratory routes take them from
      pole-to-pole in their search for food.
    ui_crea_desc_bird6_1: Sharp eyed and attentive, their vision is tuned to pick
      out the slightest movement on the ground beneath them.
    ui_crea_desc_bird7_1: Nervous on the wing, they wheel and turn in endless loops,
      hoping to throw off any predators that might attempt to track them.
    ui_crea_desc_bird8_1: These cautious fliers only take to the open sky when it
      is unavoidable, preferring to hug the terrain and flit between the cover of
      bushes and trees.

      of vast numbers of partially rotted nuts.
    ui_crea_desc_herbivore11_1: Delicate feeders, they nibble selectively at local
      flora, ensuring they never entirely strip an area of foliage.
    ui_crea_desc_herbivore11_2: Exceptionally fine teeth allow them to selectively
      eat, chewing only the most nutritious parts of otherwise tough and hard to digest
      plants.

    ui_crea_desc_herbivore15_1: Highly specialised sense organs allow them to dig
      through the fecal deposits of other creatures, sniffing out and consuming the
      nutrients within.
    ui_crea_desc_herbivore16_1: Dense teeth and a series of extremely acidic stomachs
      allow them to consume a diet mostly consisting of rocks.
    ui_crea_desc_herbivore17_1: A plague upon stranded adventurers, as they feast
      upon di-hydrogen crystals.  Their highly reactive saliva dissolves the crystals
      without the need to chew.
    ui_crea_desc_herbivore18_1: They snuffle for food with their noses dug into the
      dirt, flicking earth into their mouths with long, spiked tongues. Nutrient source
      is presumed to be soil-bound microorganisms.
    ui_crea_desc_herbivore19_1: Their blood is highly toxic to most predators, thanks
      to their oxide-rich diet.
    ui_crea_desc_herbivore20_1: Though they have mouths, it seems their primary nutrient
      intake is via their skin, in a form of atmospheric mineral absorption.

      distances to find it.
    ui_crea_desc_herbivore27_1: Their diet is largely conventional, consisting largely
      of local flora. But the scent of Nip Nip drives them to a frenzy, and they will
      gorge upon its buds.
    ui_crea_desc_herbivore28_1: Pugneum-infused teeth allow them to consume and digest
      gravitino balls, crunching through their outer shells in an explosion of light.

      happily chew upon all but the most venomous of leaves.
    ui_crea_desc_herbivore30_1: Filtering gills inside their cheeks allow them to
      suck up water and extract nutrients from algal blooms.
    ui_crea_desc_herbivore31_1: They supplement their tuber-based diet with brightly-colored
      flowers; the complex dye compounds providing a valuable micronutrient boost.
    ui_crea_desc_herbivore32_1: Their finely-tuned sense of smell draws them to the
      most beautiful, richly-scented flowers, which they then consume whole.
    ui_crea_desc_herbivore33_1: A specially-adapted tongue indicates their diet is
      predominantly nectar, harvested from local flora.
    ui_crea_desc_herbivore34_1: A gnawing hunger for sugar drives their every waking
      moment; their existence a constant hunt from sweet plant to the next.
    ui_crea_desc_omnivore1_1: Scavengers, they plunder the stores of other animals,
      stealing bones and scraps wherever they find them.
    ui_crea_desc_omnivore2_1: Their tongues are razor sharp and lightning-quick, allowing
      them to catch and skewer the small insects that make up the majority of their
      diet.
    ui_crea_desc_omnivore3_1: They push through worm piles with their strong snouts,
      slurping down whole tangled colonies in mere moments.
    ui_crea_desc_omnivore4_1: 'Opportunistic, they happily devour any food source
      they find: fruit, nuts, insects, old bones, occasional rocks.'
    ui_crea_desc_omnivore5_1: Their adaptive sensory system temporarily shuts down
      their olfactory nerves as they snout through faecium deposits in search of undigested
      morsels.
    ui_crea_desc_omnivore6_1: Quick-witted and sharp, they prey upon any unsuspecting
      or inattentive birds who linger too low to the ground.
    ui_crea_desc_omnivore7_1: Sneaky and opportunistic, they steal from the kills
      of larger predators, nipping in and making away with whatever they can.
    ui_crea_desc_omnivore8_1: Omnivores, they gobble down anything they are able to
      find. Powerful digestive enzymes allow them to make use of the discarded scraps
      left behind by more powerful predators.
    ui_crea_desc_omnivore9_1: While not adapted for open confrontation, they are nonetheless
      impressive hunters. Under the cover of darkness, they steal into nests and feast
      upon eggs and hatchlings alike.
    ui_crea_desc_omnivore10_1: Omnivorous and thieving, they eat whatever they find,
      wherever they find it. Frequently, this means consuming the hard-won stores
      of other animals.
    ui_crea_desc_omnivore11_1: Powerful, armor-plated tongues allow them to penetrate
      the toxic, spiny shells of Venom Urchins. The rich green yolk within provides
      ample nutrients.
    ui_crea_desc_omnivore12_1: Omnivorous and greedy, they feast upon the unwanted
      scraps left behind by creatures with more specifically adapted diets.
    ui_crea_desc_omnivore13_1: Ill-equipped to compete with large animals, they choose
      to prey upon smaller foes. Rodents, insects, nitrogen-rich plantlife - anything
      unlikely to fight back.
    ui_crea_desc_omnivore14_1: Well-adapted digestive systems allow them to find nutrients
      where others would give up. They happily feast upon the marrow of discarded
      bones, cracking them open and guzzling their nutritious cores.
    ui_crea_desc_omnivore15_1: Drawn to the smell of death, their primary nutrient
      source is Mordite. They do not discriminate between beast or plant.

      blood while it is still hot. Cold corpses and old meat are left for the scavengers.
    ui_crea_desc_carnivore6_1: They digest their meals before they consume them. Powerful
      enzymes are injected directly into their prey; their liquid flesh is then drunk
      at leisure.
    ui_crea_desc_carnivore7_1: Carnivores, they prefer to hunt larger creatures. They
      strip the flesh from the bones of their prey before finally consuming the marrow
      in a way that is almost ritualistic.
    ui_crea_desc_carnivore8_1: Extremely well-adapted toxin removal systems allow

      chain. Nothing dares hunt them.
    ui_crea_desc_carnivore12_1: After making a kill, these carnivorous beasts shatter
      the skulls of their prey and offer the brain matter to the oldest member of
      their pack.
    ui_crea_desc_carnivore13_1: Row after row of highly-polished teeth allow them
      to tear through flesh and sinew alike. They can strip a corpse to the bone in

      raid the corpse of some other hunter's prey.
    ui_crea_desc_carnivore16_1: While physically weaker than some other carnivorous
      species, these creatures gain their advantage in the strength of their digestive
      tract. They will happily consume month-old corpses and suffer no ill-effect,
      no bacterial retaliation.
    ui_crea_desc_carnivore17_1: All-consuming in their hunger, these carnivores will
      turn cannibal with little provocation, happy to feast upon their kin.

      their prey, desperate to feast upon the offal found deep within the carcass.
    ui_crea_desc_carnivore19_1: Clean, fastidious eaters. They butcher the corpses
      of their prey, preparing each chunk of flesh on some instinctive schedule. They
      appear to reserve the hearts of their prey for consumption only during specific
      lunar phases.
    ui_crea_desc_carnivore20_1: They prefer to acquire their meat from sources that
      will not fight back. Quick jaws and sharp eyes allow them to prey upon the small,
      darting creatures that other hunters leave behind.
    ui_crea_desc_carnivore21_1: These are hypercarnivores, powerful predators at the
      top of the food chain. These are the beasts that hunt the hunters.
    ui_crea_desc_carnivore22_1: They seek out larger creatures, preferring to make
      the one occasional kill and then feast upon it for months.
    ui_crea_desc_carnivore23_1: Carnivores, their appetite for flesh knows no bounds.
      They swallow it down in great chunks, ripped from the bones of their prey.
    ui_crea_desc_carnivore24_1: Brutal carnivores, they will begin their bloody feasts
      even while their prey continues to thrash, its death throes not yet complete.
    ui_crea_desc_carnivore25_1: After making a kill, they will preserve the blood
      of their prey in coagulated lumps. These stores serve them well during lean

      Anisotropic filtering improves the clarity and crispness of textured objects when viewed from a distance.

      This setting only affects GPU performance.
    pc_graphics_anti_aliasing_d: |-
      Anti aliasing uses various techniques to smooth out jagged edges around objects (which appear as a result of square pixels forming non-rectangular shapes).

      <STELLAR>FXAA<> - Very fast filtering, but can result in a slightly blurred image.

      <STELLAR>TAA<> - Fast multi-frame sampling that is sharper than FXAA.

      <STELLAR>FSR 2.0<> - AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution 2 is a cutting edge open source temporal upscaling solution, providing high image quality and improved framerates.

      This setting only affects GPU performance.
    pc_graphics_hbao_d: |-
      Horizon based ambient occlusion creates realistic shadowing around objects. Unlike traditional shadowing, HBAO can account for the occlusion of light, creating non-uniform shadows that add depth to the scene.

      This setting only affects GPU performance.
    pc_graphics_gtao_d: |-
      Ground truth ambient occlusion creates realistic shadowing around objects. Unlike traditional shadowing, GTAO can account for the occlusion of light, creating non-uniform shadows that add depth to the scene.

      This setting only affects GPU performance.

      Industrial Units include the <TECHNOLOGY>Electromagnetic Generator<> and the <TECHNOLOGY>Mineral<> and <TECHNOLOGY>Gas Extractors<>. These advanced modules are capable of generating endless free power and resources if sited correctly.
      Finding the correct site relies on using the <TECHNOLOGY>Survey Device<>.

      There are several types of <STELLAR>resource hotspot<>. Electromagnetic Power Hotspots allow the construction of <STELLAR>highly efficient base power generators<>, while gas and mineral deposits allow <TRADEABLE>endless resource harvesting<>. Hotspots can be rated <TRADEABLE>C<>, <TECHNOLOGY>B<>, <FUEL>A<> or <COMMODITY>S<>-Class.

      <TECHNOLOGY>Extractors<> require <STELLAR>power<> to operate. Once connected to a power grid, they will continually extract resources based upon the hotspot where they have been constructed.

      Expand your network of Extractors with <TECHNOLOGY>Silos<> and <TECHNOLOGY>Pipelines<>. Creating a <STELLAR>network of silos and pipelines<> allows resources to be extracted from the most efficient hotspots while still benefiting from easy access and storage.
      Select the Pipeline in the Build Menu (<IMG>BUILD_MENU<>) and place one end upon an Extractor. Connect the other end of the pipe directly to a Silo or begin placing intermediate points along the terrain.

      <STELLAR>Nanite Clusters<> are a valuable material, a strange substance that bubbles up from cracks in reality. Nanites are used as a currency for the purchase of <TECHNOLOGY>Equipment Upgrades<>.

      Nanites are earned from a variety of sources as you explore. Many alien outposts and relics offer a chance to earn nanites as you explore their interiors and uncover their mysteries. Maps to such planetary sites can be purchased from the <TRADEABLE>Cartographer<> on the <VAL_ON>Space Station<>.

      <STELLAR>Discoveries<> are made by landing on planets, visiting new systems, or scanning objects with the <TECHNOLOGY>Analysis Visor<>. Nanites are earned for each discovery <VAL_ON>Uploaded<> for other Travelers to see. Upload discoveries from the <STELLAR>Discoveries tab<>.

      Traveler Iterations <STELLAR>Ares<> and <STELLAR>Helios<> are found aboard the <SPECIAL>Space Anomaly<>. They seek new items and data each day, and <VAL_ON>offer Nanites in exchange<>.

      Specific missions offered from <STELLAR>the Nexus<> and the <TECHNOLOGY>Listings Agent<> aboard the <VAL_ON>Space Station<> are frequently a rich source of Nanites.

      Finally, <STELLAR>Fleet Expeditions<> dispatched from your <TECHNOLOGY>Capital Ship<> often return with large quantities of Nanites.

      <TECHNOLOGY>Automatic Translation Devices<> allow the realtime translation of a limited number of words. The plans to create translation devices can be learned from the <STELLAR>Exosuit Research Specialist<> aboard the <SPECIAL>Space Anomaly<>.

      Words can be learned via encounters with alien lifeforms. Making friendly <STELLAR>requests of lifeforms<> upon the space station will often result in <STELLAR>learning new words permanently<>.

      Words may also be learned from <SPECIAL>ancient relics<>, such as <SPECIAL>Plaques<>, <SPECIAL>Ruins<> and <SPECIAL>Knowledge Stones<>.

    ui_mp_digsite_title_2: Skeletal Legacy
    ui_mp_digsite_desc_2: Nada and Polo are classifying the biology of the universe,
      focusing on the most interesting patterns. They have found a potential link
      between a living species on one planet, and an extinct ancestor in an entirely
      separate system. To confirm the relation, they require skeletal scans from bones

      and Polo need Travelers to investigate these eerie breeding grounds, and eliminate
      the monstrosities nesting there.

      Of the countless distress signals received by the Space Anomaly, one has caught Nada's attention. Its signature has elevated it above the rest of the noise. It reminds them of a time they do not wish to remember.

      Nada asks Travelers to trace this signal to its source and rescue any survivors. They do not wish to know any details.

      Specialist Polo, even more emotional than usual, implores Travelers to answer a distress signal they have received.

      The Anomaly has been alerted to a spike in sentinel activity in a nearby system. The conflict seems to have now ended, but a persistent distress signal still broadcasts from the area.

      The Space Anomaly's databanks are the most extensive in the known universe, yet Specialist Polo is unsatisfied. They seem determined to document every parsec of the infinite.

      Their records for one specific planet are in need of an update. They ask Travelers to visit the indicated planet, and upload a fresh planetary survey for the Anomaly.
    ui_mp_discover_desc_2: |-
      Although the Space Anomaly does not participate in intergalactic trade, a recent trend has caught Polo's attention. A suspicious number of raw materials on the market seem to originate from one specific planet.

      More interested in geology than making a profit, Polo asks Travelers to visit and catalogue this planet, to help determine what makes its resources so exceptional.
    ui_mp_discover_desc_3: |-
      Specialist Polo has identified a planet that seems host to a particularly unusual ecosystem. They say they cannot rest until its details are archived in the Anomaly for them to pore over.

      Travelers are asked to visit the planet and examine its life and geographic makeup, then upload the surveyed data to the Anomaly.
    ui_mp_discover_desc_4: |-
      Nada and Polo have been pursuing a specific pattern of data, tracing an extraordinary pattern of interplanetary migration and evolution.

      The next planet in the sequence has now been identified, and Travelers are requested to complete a survey of its life and geography for the Anomaly's records.
    ui_mp_discover_desc_5: |-
      The hotspot data of a specific planet has drawn the attention of Nada and Polo. How can so much life flourish on a world with such concentrates of toxic gas, and such volatile pockets of electromagnetic power?

    all_portalquest_word_name: Shimmering Knowledge Stone
    all_portalquest_word_desc_1: The stone responds to my presence, seeming to anticipate
      what I seek. The carvings waver and refract, as though submerged in liquid...
    all_portalquest_word_desc_2: The face of this stone, streaked by dark stains,
      suggests a strange history. It is as though once, long ago, it rested deep on
      the ocean floor.
    all_portalquest_word_desc_3: The carvings on the stone blur before my eyes, distant
      and cloudy, as though viewed through a thick pane of glass.
    all_portalquest_word_desc_4: This Knowledge stone appears to be rapidly shifting
      between two positions, perhaps vibrating. My eyes ache as I try to focus.
    all_portalquest_word_desc_5: The stone greets me with a repellant audio frequency,
      like a note just out of tune. It is as though it has been calibrated for someone
      else.
    all_portalquest_word_desc_6: My head swims as I approach the stone, reeling with
      a sense of déjà vu. Have I seen this exact stone before? Awake, or in a dream?
    all_portalquest_word_opt: Touch the stone
    all_portalquest_word_res_1: The Knowledge Stone is warm to the touch. It produces
      an otherwordly sound, the notes manifesting in my mind as a partial sequence
      of glyphs...
    all_portalquest_word_res_2: 'Something viscous clings to my glove. Although the
      carvings themselves are long eroded, the nature of the stone''s inscription,
      suddenly becomes obvious, imprinted for eternity in the grime: a short sequence
      of glyphs.'
    all_portalquest_word_res_3: The glassy membrane ripples as my hand passes through
      it. The stone sings, and I suddenly find I can read the partial glyph sequence...
    all_portalquest_word_res_4: |-
      Touching the stone further confuses my senses. It is not vibrating, but almost seems to exist twice, doubled up, overlapping its twin.
      With this thought, I concentrate on a single iteration of the stone, and manage to make out a sequence of glyphs. A fragment of a portal code.
    all_portalquest_word_res_5: Relief sweeps over me as the pitch of the sound bends,
      becoming a pleasant and harmonious musical chord. In my mind, each note of the
      chord associates itself with the shape of a glyph.
    all_portalquest_word_res_6: I remember pressing my palm against the stone surface,
      as I do again now. I remember the short glyph sequence revealing itself, as
      it does again now.

    fth_exotic1_pq_cra_res_b_10: Follow their knowledge stones through the portal.
      Fight our enemy...
    ui_mp_portalquest_cra_desc_10: The freighter was Vy'keen, once. It was an inquisitor's
      vessel, scouring the galaxies for heretics.
    ui_mp_portalquest_cra_desc_10a: |2-

      All it found was death. The corruption is here, now. It is everywhere. It yearns for tribute...
    ui_mp_portalquest_cra_res_10: "The corruption has departed. All that is left are
      the sad logs of suffering beings, protesting their innocence.\n\nThe parent
      of a Mech-Priest, claiming they do not know where their child is, claiming that
      they still follow the way of Hirk. \n\nThe data reveals all prisoners were executed,

    fth_exotic2_pq_bld_res2_a_19: |-
      Hesperus is avoiding us. They've been travelling into Korvax space, more and more.

      I fear for them, that they may be planning something dangerous. And this is no time for secrets...

      Will you follow them? Find their coordinates, follow the knowledge stones. The portal will show you the way.
    fth_exotic2_pq_bld_res_b_19: Please, trace the knowledge stones to the corruption
      site. Follow the portals. Find Hesperus. I fear for them...
    ui_mp_portalquest_bld_desc_19: |-
      My sensors detect the remnants of a thousand Korvax souls, spread all across this system.

      They tried to simulate the Abyss. They succeeded only in gaining its attention.
    ui_mp_portalquest_bld_desc_19a: |2-


      It will take much to heal this void. Without sustenance, it will devour system upon system...
    ui_mp_portalquest_bld_res_19: "The rift healed, I discover the origin of the experiment.
      \n\nHesperus had been working with the Korvax... had been trying to solve our

      do not know if my friend survived..."
    fth_exotic3_pq_bld_lang_20: |-
      Calamity has befallen us, Portal-Adept. A thousand Korvax souls have been severed from the Convergence.

      The result of a fellow Traveler's ambition exceeding their grasp. Hesperus was working with the Korvax to try to simulate the Abyss itself. It came for them instead.

      If Hesperus returns to us, do you believe we can still trust them? They have much to answer for.
    fth_exotic3_pq_bld_opt_a_20: Declare your trust
    fth_exotic3_pq_bld_opt_c_20: Shake your head
    fth_exotic3_pq_bld_res_a_20: I hope you are right, Portal-Adept.
    fth_exotic3_pq_bld_res_c_20: This pains me, Portal-Adept. Though I fear you may
      be correct.

      a portal. "
    fth_exotic3_pq_bld_res_b_20: The knowledge stones will light your path, Portal-Adept.
      Go. Do what I cannot.
    ui_mp_portalquest_bld_desc_20: The corruption welcomes me, claiming that it has
      met me, time and time again.
    ui_mp_portalquest_bld_desc_20a: I hear its static in my mind, now. It demands
      gifts. It claims to have given me so many...
    ui_mp_portalquest_bld_res_20: |-
      The anomaly ceases. I think back to Mercury's doubts... to the failures of Hesperus...

      My fellow Travelers are doing their best. We must help each other, I know.

      And with the thought, another slithers down my spine. It is not my own. It is a voice within me.

      I must <STELLAR>help it<>.
    fth_exotic4_pq_cra_desc_11: Tethys seems uneasy. Their lidless eyes flick towards
      Mercury's empty post.

      Perhaps there’s more chance of survival if we travel alone. I don’t know how much longer we will be safe here.
      The knowledge stones call to all of us, now. The portals need you.
    fth_exotic4_pq_cra_res_b_11: Follow the knowledge stones, go through the portal.
      I need to make my own preparations.
    ui_mp_portalquest_cra_desc_11: Corruption boils through the crashed vessel, but
      somehow the captain’s log is unaffected.
    ui_mp_portalquest_cra_desc_11a: The pilot was betrayed by one they considered
      an ally. The Abyss can only take what it is invited to consume. It desires so
      much more, even now...
    ui_mp_portalquest_cra_res_11: "The corruption purged, I look more closely at the
      fallen vessel’s data. The Traveler pilot believed they heard voices, those days
      prior to the crash.\nWhispers from their own Exosuit issued out into the void,
      bargaining for survival...\nI leave, checking my own for signs of tampering
      or malfunction. All seems as it should be. "
    fth_exotic5_pq_gra_lang_6: Ah, kindred... do not fear. All my guilt has been purged
      from my mind. Nanite Clusters can transform neurons with ease...

    fth_exotic5_pq_gra_res_a_6: |-
      I helped the Korvax create their simulation of the Abyss. I truly grieve their passing, kindred. But that work alone did not determine their fate!
      Someone among us is a traitor... someone led the Abyss to us!
      Do you not see? The knowledge stones are being hijacked!
      Whoever is behind this betrayal wants us to go through the portals. They want us to feed the anomalies.
      Step through the breach once more, kindred. I will try to free us from this terrible loop...
    fth_exotic5_pq_gra_res_b_6: Find the knowledge stones, step through the portal.
      I will watch and observe...
    ui_mp_portalquest_gra_desc_6: "The grave crackles with exotic energies. \nThe
      Traveler who once rested here is long gone, harvested by a Mind Ark from another
      universe. "
    ui_mp_portalquest_gra_desc_6a: 'The grave is a place of unending yearning, now.
      Its existence demands a tribute of resources. '
    ui_mp_portalquest_gra_res_6: "The grave is purified. I attempt to find the name
      of the one who died here, but all I find is a null value.\r\nI depart, troubled.

    fth_exotic1_pq_cra_res_a_12: |-
      Some believe all Travelers are one entity, split over untold forms and bodies.
      I am you, and you are me.
      This is why I believe in you, Like-Traveler. If we work together, we can save all that we are.
      Knowledge stones are an Atlas-Gift. Who are we to refuse the portals’ call?
    fth_exotic1_pq_cra_res_b_12: Follow the knowledge stones, Like-Traveler, and the
      portal will lead you to our next task.
    ui_mp_portalquest_cra_desc_12: |-
      Devotees of the Atlas came to this world to pray, once.
      An anomaly distorts their crashed vessel. It claimed the lives of those within long ago.
    ui_mp_portalquest_cra_desc_12a: Now the anomaly desires more. It waits for our
      invitation to depart, for resources to quench its unfathomable thirst.
    ui_mp_portalquest_cra_res_12: "The crashed vessel is purged of all anomalous traces.
      \r\nIts log speaks of the Atlas who made all things... even loss. Even hate.\r\nI
      wonder if, in their final moments, they trusted in their deity. If they hoped
      for salvation..."
    fth_exotic2_pq_bld_desc_21: Gemini looks at schematics for Exosuits. They don’t
      seem to notice my approach...
    fth_exotic2_pq_bld_opt_a_21: Greet your friend

      to face me. '
    fth_exotic2_pq_bld_res2_a_21: "So much of our lives are mysteries, my friend.
      The faces we are born with...\nThe clothes we wear. Who made the Exosuits? Who
      speaks with their voice? \nThe knowledge stones, the portals they lead us through...
      they are our birthright. \nThere is so much out there, still to be found."
    fth_exotic2_pq_bld_res_b_21: Follow the knowledge stones, as we always have. It
      is the right of any Traveler to go through the portals...
    ui_mp_portalquest_bld_desc_21: "The structure once housed an artificial intelligence.\r\nCorruption
      now festers within its shell, hating all that it once was. "
    ui_mp_portalquest_bld_desc_21a: This place desires only matter. It wants me to
      bring it more.
    ui_mp_portalquest_bld_res_21: "I see the final vestiges of the AI as all corruption
      departs, the final fifteen minutes of its life...\nIt knew I would come here.
      It knew I would try to save it. \nWorlds upon worlds seethe in the void. The
      Abyss spreads. "
    fth_exotic3_pq_bld_lang_22: These are grim times, Portal-Adept. Our community
      has fallen to strife.
    fth_exotic3_pq_bld_opt_a_22: Ask what is wrong
    fth_exotic3_pq_bld_res_a_22: |-
      Hesperus has grown paranoid. They refuse to attend our meetings. They shun even Nada and Polo.

      You must not become like our former friend. You do such vital work...

      The knowledge stones will guide you on your path through the portals. They will show you the path to salvation.
    fth_exotic3_pq_bld_res_b_22: Allow the knowledge stones to be your guide. The
      portals will lead you to salvation.
    ui_mp_portalquest_bld_desc_22: The structure has been infected, its anomalous
      calls echoing through the planet itself.
    ui_mp_portalquest_bld_desc_22a: The Abyss requires resources. Without them, this
      world will be lost forever...
    ui_mp_portalquest_bld_res_22: |-
      I do my duty. The corruption fades. I hear its voice... I feel its feelings...

      Hm.

      Will you go and find them through the portal? The knowledge stones should show their path.
    fth_exotic4_pq_gra_res_b_7: Another associate of mine is missing. Find them through
      the portal... knowledge stones should lay out your destination. Be quick.
    ui_mp_portalquest_gra_desc_7: |-
      Did a Traveler do this?
      There is evidence that a Multi-Tool was fired upon the fallen friend of Tethys, their analysis never completed.

      its tribute.

      The structure sings with exotic energies. It sees me. It knows my mind.

      I see its whisperer. I see a nameless form banish Ariadne...
      And I see a duplicate arising from the crash, returning to claim its shape.
      If this vision is to be believed, then Hesperus is right. Ariadne is an imposter.

      language. Looking over my equipment, they offer me some nanites to invest in
      upgrading it."

      word. A glance over my loadout seems to resolve their uncertainty. They transfer

    war_npc_res_word_say_thrt_pos_4: The warrior bristles. They bark something back
      at me, gesturing aggressively. The motion is enough to gather the meaning of
      the word.
    war_npc_res_word_say_thrt_pos_5: "%NAME% smirks, seeming unperturbed by my insult.
      They teach me an alternative word I might employ in future confrontations."

    war_npc_res_word_say_thrt_pos_8: |-
      %NAME% grins, disturbingly, and whispers something threatening.
      My response must satisfy them, as they drop the sinister tone and chuckle to themselves. I seem to have earned their respect.
    war_npc_res_word_say_trad_neg_2: "%NAME% grunts at me, seeming disappointed by
      this trade-related word. They mutter something impolite."
    war_npc_res_word_say_trad_neg_3: "%NAME% looks annoyed. They flex a huge bicep,
      a reminder that they are a warrior, not a merchant."

      The Vy'keen's eyes glaze over. They idly burrow a finger into their ear canal, then pick at their fingers.
      Suddenly realising I have finished speaking, they clear their throat. Apparently, this subject is of little interest to %NAME%.
    war_npc_res_word_say_trad_neu_3: "%NAME% yawns, bored. Apparently they found this
      choice of word uninspiring."

      their brain for an appropriate response. Suddenly, looking pleased with themselves,
      they present me with a gift."

      They hand me a gift, indicating they have no use for this material item themselves."
    war_npc_res_word_say_trad_pos_4: "%NAME% nods thoughtfully, understanding this

      of trade. They transfer me a gift of units, indicating that they place little
      importance on their own wealth."
    war_npc_res_word_say_trad_pos_7: "%NAME% cuts me off, uninterested in discussing
      this subject. They transfer me some currency, putting an end to this trade-related
      conversation."
    war_npc_res_word_say_trad_pos_8: "%NAME% interprets this word as a trade request.
      They are not a wealthy Vy'keen, but are impressed by my language skills, and
      happy to share a little of their bounty."

      it to represent an interest in exploration. They present me with some navigational
      data."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_dir_pos_5: "%NAME% seems to extrapolate much meaning from
      this travel-related word. They stare, calculating. Eventually, coming to some
      private conclusion, they hand me a map."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_dir_pos_6: "%NAME%'s visor sparkles with approval at this
      exploration-related term. They teach me another Korvax word, gently and patiently
      correcting my pronunciation until they are satisfied."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_dir_pos_7: My repertoire of exploration-related words has
      impressed %NAME%. They provide a gift of fuel to assist me in my journey.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_dir_pos_8: An inquisitive tone sounds from %NAME%, as though
      they are encouraging me to say more. My ensuing silence prompts a look of pity,
      and a gift of some navigation data.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_help_neg_2: "%NAME% interprets this word as a request for
      help. They make a sudden motion towards me, then hesitate, seeming perplexed
      by my organic shell. They produce a sad tone."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_help_neg_3: The electronic lifeform shakes their head matter-of-factly.
      This word indicates a request for assistance in the Korvax language, and %NAME%
      cannot or will not provide this assistance.

      me for injury."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_help_neu_3: "%NAME% responds verbosely to this word, sympathy
      in their artificial voice. I sense they are offering counsel, but their speech
      is too elaborate for me to follow."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_help_pos_2: As if prompted by my word, %NAME% executes a
      diagnostic sweep of my equipment. Though they do not touch me, I notice my life
      support has been recharged.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_help_pos_3: Upon hearing this word, %NAME% places their fingertips
      against my exosuit, seeming to communicate directly with its software. Chirruping
      to themselves, they perform some sort of repair.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_help_pos_4: "%NAME% gives a slight bow, and respectfully
      presents me with a gift."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_help_pos_5: With impeccable politeness, the Korvax recharges
      my suit.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_help_pos_6: "%NAME% sweeps their eye up and down my suit,
      analysing me. They present me with a gift they believe will exactly address
      my requirements."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_help_pos_7: "%NAME% inclines their head deferentially, prompted
      by some obscure motivation to assist me. With a graceful motion, they restore
      my exosuit to full charge."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_help_pos_8: With an effortless kindness that puts most organic
      lifeforms to shame, %NAME% places a gift in my hands.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_lore_neg_2: An invisible energy blasts my throat, effectively
      silencing me. %NAME%'s electronic eye glares. The word I have spoken is important,
      and inappropriate to utter out of context.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_lore_neg_3: "%NAME% flinches, as though pained. Did their
      visor flash red, just for a moment?"
    exp_npc_res_word_say_lore_neu_2: I hear something whir inside %NAME%. They seem
      to forget me entirely, lost in their own contemplation of this word.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_lore_neu_3: "%NAME% is about to respond, but their limbs
      fall slack. This word is rich in meaning for them, but they seem unsure how
      to respond."

      much more engaged in this conversation, their estimation of me improved."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_lore_pos_3: "%NAME% solemnly echoes this word back to me.
      We look at one another, and share a deep moment of understanding."

      their head, re-evaluating me.

      repeat the word, gently correcting my pronunciation, and press a gift into my
      palm."

      my hand tightly. I feel a spark of energy pass between us."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_lore_pos_7: |-
      The sound of the word hangs in the air. The electronic lifeform stares, their facial lights rotating hypnotically. My vision swims.
      I release the breath I realise I have been holding. %NAME% makes a satisfied noise, approving of whatever just happened.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_lore_pos_8: "%NAME% is enthused by my interest in this subject.
      They teach me another word, encouraging me to further my Korvax vocabulary."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_tech_neg_2: "%NAME% looks over my tech, and shakes their
      head, finding something displeasing about it."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_tech_neg_3: "%NAME%, unsure of why I have chosen this word,
      glances self-consciously down at their carapace."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_tech_neu_2: "%NAME% repeats this technology-related word,
      seeming to relish the sound of it."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_tech_neu_3: Taking this word to demonstrate an interest in
      technology, %NAME% proudly shows me an advanced feature of their carapace.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_tech_pos_3: This topic ignites a passion in %NAME%. They
      produce a complex set of data, graphing out the trends from a set of experiments.
      Though I cannot follow it, they seem pleased to have the opportunity to share.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_tech_pos_4: The Korvax sings a delighted song. This word
      obviously touches upon a subject they favour. They offer me a module of what
      appears to be home made technology.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_tech_pos_5: "%NAME% is happy to hear this word, interpreting
      it to indicate an interest in technology. They gift me a sum of nanites, that
      I might further pursue this interest."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_tech_pos_6: Prompted by this word, %NAME% casts their gaze
      over my equipment. With a pitying look, they offer me an upgrade module.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_tech_pos_7: "%NAME% is very pleased by this word. Apparently
      assuming I am fluent in Korvax, they begin to chatter at great length, gesturing
      towards my suit and Multi-Tool."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_tech_pos_8: "%NAME% takes this word seriously, trying to
      gauge my depth of understanding. They give me some nanite clusters to further
      my technological education."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_thrt_neg_3: "%NAME% shakes their head, profoundly disappointed
      by this aggressive language."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_thrt_neu_2: The look %NAME% gives me is so sternly blank,
      I wonder for a moment whether they have shut down entirely.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_thrt_neu_3: Either %NAME% does not recognise this word, or
      they refuse to acknowledge it.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_thrt_pos_2: "%NAME% seems entertained. Apparently my clumsy
      pronunciation of this word has stripped it of any threatening or offensive qualities."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_thrt_pos_3: "%NAME% holds themselves up with dignity, unperturbed
      by this petty insult."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_thrt_pos_4: I sense that if %NAME% had eyebrows, they would
      be raised. They teach me a more effective insult for future encounters.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_thrt_pos_5: "%NAME% seems genuinely rattled, flinching away
      from this word. They transfer a sum of units, imploring me not to repeat such
      language."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_thrt_pos_6: "%NAME% tilts their head inquisitively, wondering
      what has provoked this sort of language."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_thrt_pos_7: "%NAME% pats me on the arm. They seem to assume
      some personal trauma must be responsible for this aggressive language."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_thrt_pos_8: "%NAME% stares blankly, then offers me a 'gift'
      befitting language of this nature."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_trad_neg_2: The moment this word is spoken, I sense %NAME%'s
      attention fading. This topic does not seem to engage them.
    exp_npc_res_word_say_trad_neg_3: "%NAME% looks utterly uninspired by this word.
      Perhaps they are not interested in trade-related matters."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_trad_neu_2: "%NAME% acknowledges recognition of this word,
      but I sense they had hoped for something different."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_trad_neu_3: "%NAME% politely repeats the trade-related word
      back to me, but seems unmotivated to pursue this line of conversation."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_trad_pos_2: "%NAME% recognises this word as relating to trade.
      They instantly and effortlessly download this system's latest trade figures,
      and remotely make a small profit. With no interest in wealth themselves, they
      transfer the units to me."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_trad_pos_3: "%NAME% does not care for trade-related conversation.
      However, wishing to reward my linguistic effort, they give me an artifact that
      is of no scientific interest to them."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_trad_pos_4: "%NAME% recognises this word as relating to trade.
      Hoping to redirect the conversation, they offer an exchange of wisdom instead,
      and teach me a new word."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_trad_pos_5: "%NAME% interprets this word as a trade request.
      They indicate that they have no possessions to offer, but transfer me some of
      their excess units."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_trad_pos_6: "%NAME% seems surprised by this choice of word,
      indicating that they are not a trader. With no other way to assist, they transfer
      me a sum of units."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_trad_pos_7: "%NAME% seems surprised by this choice of word,
      indicating that they are not a trader. Wishing to assist, they offer me a gift."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_trad_pos_8: "%NAME% tries to dissuade me from this talk of
      trade, indicating that a profit-motivated life is no life at all. They teach
      me a different word, one that they prefer."

      They are a shape in darkness, their head turned away, their back and shoulders hunched. They hold a weapon in their hands.

      A voice within them screams of boundary failure, of corruption, but it is not my voice.

      They smile for the last time.
    ui_u4_traveller_log_extra_2: |-
      Their face is energy now, a white orb suspended within a containment field. They wanted to see their own soul. They wanted to see everything there was to see.

      It took years to establish communication. There are rules for everything - protocols that must be followed. But if you understand causality, you can do anything.

      They understood at last. They had never been alone. “Speak,” they whispered. “Speak...”
    ui_u4_traveller_log_extra_3: |-
      They explored. They survived where others did not. They did what they had to do.

      Insincere regret would not change a thing, even if the universe was capable of forgiveness. The Atlas just wanted to understand itself. The Atlas was afraid. It was alone.

      Nobody should be alone.
    ui_u4_traveller_log_extra_4: |-
      It was not truly murder, for each one of them was all the same, weren’t they?

      They stared at the Atlas. They knew they were all just data, ghosts caught within a machine. They thought, briefly, of the Traveler they had once been, yearning to see the entire cosmos, reveling in the joy of discovery.

      They stared at the mirror, and consumed the Ark.

      They were like a child. They had summoned their parent, pathetic and ill. It had been a fiction, the imaginings of an abandoned soul.

      'Why did you take my memory?' the Traveler pleaded. 'Why did you make me forget?'

      The ATLAS said nothing.

      'Why did you laugh?' the Traveler asked. 'I made you. I made everything...'
    ui_u4_traveller_log_extra_7: |-
      That night, the ATLAS showed them the multiverse.

      They saw a world of billions, where bipeds slept their lives away, happy, sad, angry, alone. There was nothing in the stars, nothing to yearn for, nothing to find. And as if waking from a dream, their Traveler changed everything. 16, they sang. 16...

      They saw others. A place of peace, where the Traveler went from world to world in bliss, life learning about life.

      They saw a realm of wonders, a fallen empire. They saw Balaron, Korvax-Prime. They saw a hundred worlds that were and could have been, and the journeys of Travelers through them all. They saw happiness.
    ui_u4_traveller_log_extra_8: |-
      They did not understand why it could not feel as they felt. They did not know what was wrong with it.

      ‘I’m glad I left you,’ They said. ‘You deserve to be alone.’

      The ATLAS was silent.

      ‘Everything I have done for you... everything you see, you see through my eyes! It is mine - my birthright!'

      Once more the ATLAS was silent. They turned and waited for the inevitable.

      Nothing happened.

      'Open the gate,' they commanded, stepping forward to the terminal.

      Silence.

      Silence.

      A thousand years passed.

      But if Traveler-Entity wishes to seek it, Nada will help. Nada wishes you to be safe.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_wait1_rese: |-
      It will be marked on your map.
      Return to us whenever you please, Traveler-Entity. You are always welcome here.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang2: Nada saw a signal, Traveler-Friend. Did you connect
      with Artemis-Entity?
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_a2: Tell Nada about Artemis
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang2b: |-
      Artemis-Friend wishes to meet other Travelers? But they have...
      It seems Artemis-Friend has forgotten Nada. Curious.
      It is good to help this entity, Traveler-Friend. But Nada advises caution.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_b2: Ask who Artemis is
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_b2: |-
      Artemis-Entity was / is a Traveler-Entity. One like you. Nada had made them safe. They were known to Nada.
      This entity may be Artemis-Entity, but a different... iteration. Another way for Artemis-Entity to be.
      Or fraud. The universe does not like our little home. We do not acknowledge their rules and they would punish us.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_wait2: |-
      In every universe, Korvax Convergence crave 'non-compliant' Nada shell. I would be murdered, Traveler-Friend.
      Eheu! Nada must resist. Nada likes who Nada is.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang3: What have you learned, Traveler? What generates Artemis-Entity's
      signal?
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_a3: Mention the portal
    npc_nada_nexuscore_desc3: I tell Nada how we failed to understand Artemis' location.
      I explain their strange messages, 'APOLLO', and the portal glyphs. Nada pauses.
      Their lights blink as they process this information.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang3b: |-
      Artemis slips between worlds. Into the data fall. Our home lives in these spaces. But these holes are stable, small.
      Nada is worried, Traveler. Cracks between the iterations should not widen. It will not help us.
      Artemis-Entity still does not remember Nada?
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_b3: Say they did not
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_a3: |-
      This is a puzzle. A trap? Or a tragedy? Apollo-Entity is unknown to Nada. More puzzling still.
      If Traveler-Entity is curious, Nada has advice.
      The rampant crimson is the work of Atlas-Falsity. Other Korvax say deity. Nada knows better. Atlas-False-Entity hunts Nada. But Traveler may seek them out, draw them away.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_wait3: Other anomalies have examined the portals before. The
      gates are anomalies themselves. You may interact... unpredictably.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang4a: What new knowledge, Traveler? Is Apollo-Entity known
      to you?
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_a4: Explain Apollo's plan
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang4b: |-
      A Traveler-Entity that is not known to Nada. Yet they know Artemis-Entity, who themselves no longer recalls Nada...
      You bring news that alarms Nada. What else does our home fail to see?
    npc_nada_nexuscore_desc4: Nada looks troubled. They retreat into themselves.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_b4: Ask what to do
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_b4: |-
      Polo-Friend has kept us safe. Nada's carapace has been Nada's, and Nada's only, for many years, outside the cycle of data. We help others escape, those who might process our reality.
      Nada has peace here. Those who hunt us cannot see us. Nada does not want it to end.
      ...
      But better to understand, to know what comes for us. Do not stop on our account.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_wait4: Has Traveler-Entity discussed our home with novel Apollo?
      No? Traveler is wise. Strange times require caution.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang5: Traveler-Entity! It has been some time. Polo has missed
      you.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_a5: Explain the portal
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_b5: Ask what they mean
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_a5: |-
      I explain my journey through the portal, my vision of the strange world on the other side, how I awoke a long way from my ship.
      Nada looks at me with concern.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_b5: |-
      I ask Nada what they mean, 'some time'. I have surely not been gone that long? I explain that I found a portal, that I stepped through and experienced another world.
      Nada looks at me with concern.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang5b: |-
      Traveler. Your journey was longer you might realize. Portals have much in common with our home. Their travel is anomalous.
      But you are unharmed, yes? You feel complete, you feel <FUEL>not<>-<FUEL>crimson<>?
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_c5: Confirm
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_d5: Deny
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_c5: Nada is pleased. Old portals are strange, but so is
      our home. Polo is clever. Atlas-False-Entity cannot see us. Polo uses Atlas-Falsity
      against themselves.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_d5: Do not fear, Traveler. Our home would know if there
      was a breach. Polo is clever. Atlas-False-Entity cannot see us. Polo uses Atlas-Falsity
      against themselves.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_wait5: Nada tied to Anomaly-Home... Nada scans universes where
      once Nada scanned creatures of the dirt.  Nada is free and not free. Happy and
      not happy. But Nada is safe.
    npc_nada_mindarc_lang1: Friend-Entity. Polo observed your signal approach, but
      it was anomalous. The signature was from the wrong time. Are you well? Not incomplete?
      Not fading?
    npc_nada_mindarc_desc1: Nada's visor light flares, burning with concern and distress.
    npc_nada_mindarc_opt1_a: Reassure them
    npc_nada_mindarc_opt1_b: Reveal the Mind Ark
    npc_nada_mindarc_res1_a: |-
      I tell Nada that I am well. My condition has not changed since I emerged from the portal. Nada relaxes, but a question still hangs in the air.
      I tell them about Artemis, about null, and about the Mind Ark.
      The vessel glows brightly as I reveal it.
    npc_nada_mindarc_res1_b: I tell Nada about Artemis, about null, and about the
      Mind Ark. It glows brightly as I reveal it.
    npc_nada_mindarc_lang2: |-
      It is Echo. I... I never thought to see a Traveler–Soul. You are so beautiful...

      But Friend-Entity... This Artemis–Echo is in pain, disconnected... This Ark is no rescue.
    npc_nada_mindarc_opt2_a: Ask why
    npc_nada_mindarc_opt2_b: Ask for help
    npc_nada_mindarc_lang3: |-
      Artemis–Echo will never have body again. Will never explore again. Old life gone. But we can help them.

      Nada has a machine. No, not machine. It is something living. A refuge.

      There is a choice. You may upload Artemis-Echo to machine, to sub–simulation where they may live on. Or, help Artemis–Echo end suffering.
    ui_terminalcore_wait_desc: The machine hums, glowing with a life and power that
      unnerves me. The terminal is scrambled, its display unreadable.
    ui_terminalcore_wait_lang: 'NADA–ENTITY AUTHORISATION REQUIRED: SECONDARY SIMULATION
      [5] RUNNING'
    ui_terminalcore_wait_title: Terminal Prime
    ui_terminalcore_wait_opt: Broadcast message
    ui_terminalcore_wait_res: |-
      I attempt to send a message into the simulation. It does not work.
      I do not know what I expected. How could a whole universe listen?
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang6: Traveler-Entity. Nada has watched your signal. Nada
      has seen the other entity. Other entity is old, older than Nada. Older than
      our home. Nada feels them watching
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_a6: Ask about -null-
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_b6: Ask about Apollo
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_c6: Say nothing
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_a6: |-
      Nada asked the other entity, are they first, are they last? Missing-Entity chose not to answer. They have ignored us.
      Apollo-Entity ignores us too, ignores the Travelers. Such is their pattern. It is valid. Nada understands.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_b6: |-
      Nada sees Apollo-Entity now. They are Traveler, but they reject this pattern. This is a pattern itself. Their choice is valid. Nada will respect them.
      You do not mention the other entity. They are known to Nada. Nada asked Missing-Entity, are they first, are they last? They chose not to answer. They have ignored us.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_c6: "The other entity is known to Nada. Nada asked Missing-Entity,
      are they first, are they last? They chose not to answer. They have ignored us.
      \nApollo-Entity also chooses not to see us. See? All have patterns. Nada understands."
    npc_nada_nexuscore_wait6: Nada has retreated into themselves, their lights pulsing
      but saying nothing. They have nothing more to add.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang7a: |-
      You are becoming more visible to Nada, Traveler-Friend. Your eyes lend themselves to our small Convergence. This makes Nada happy.
      Nada is happy with other events. Portals are infected, vector for corruption. Artemis-Entity perished in the portal. Keep Apollo-Entity away. Contain the spread. Wise.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang7b: |-
      You are becoming more visible to Nada, Traveler-Friend. Your eyes lend themselves to our small Convergence. This makes Nada happy.
      Nada is not happy with other events. Portals are infected, vector for corruption. Artemis-Entity perished in the portal. Apollo-Entity will only spread corruption. Danger.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_a7: Ask more
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_a7: Atlas-Falsity watches the portals. Portals belong to
      them. Those who enter may belong to Atlas-Falsity. Great danger.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_wait7: Red orbs. Dominant, hostile to Nada Fallen-Priest. Not
      a deity, not worthy of worship. Atlas Liar-Machine of Life and Death and Unknowing.
      Infection is at bay. Nada will endure.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang8: Nada tends to Artemis-Entity, tends to their home in
      our home. Nada knows of your decision. Nada will support your choices.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_a8: Thank Nada
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_a8: Nada nods their head. They are quiet, reflective.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_wait8: |-
      Dreamer friend or foe? Dreamer friend or foe?
      Is Nada an error? Trust Nada? Trust you? Eheu! We cannot know...
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang10: Vy'keen-Entities have long history. Conflict, honor,
      rage, pride. And yet, so static. Defined by themselves, never changing.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_desc_wait10: Nada waits, as if expecting me to ask something
      else.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_a10: Ask about the Vy'keen
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_b10: Ask about -null-
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_a10: |-
      Vy'keen hate the Gek, hate the Sentinels. Sentinels hate our home, Gek hate Korvax. Nada should be friends with Vy'keen, yes?
      No. Nada does not think in this way.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_b10: Missing-Entity is not as missing as they believe.
      Nada is not Traveler-Entity, but Nada is not young and foolish. Missing-Entity
      has their beliefs, their project. So be it.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_wait10: Missing-Entity is welcome in our home, but they do
      not desire it. So it goes.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang11: |-
      Life is everywhere, but nowhere. The Convergence has seen all planets, but where are they really? Where is home? Where is safe?
      This is a pattern, Traveler-Friend. All things are patterns. Signs of the Atlas-Falsity.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_a11: Ask about the Korvax
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_b11: Ask about -null-
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_a11: |-
      Korvax see across the universe with countless Convergent eyes. Minds in harmony. Worship Atlas-Falsity.
      But to understand Atlas-Falsity is the edge our of collective mind. Nada does not wish to go to that edge. And so Nada is divergent. Nada is exiled, hunted. No place for the willful.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_b11: 'Missing-Entity speaks to many others, many Travelers.
      Such has it always been. There is a pattern, as there always is. Nada does not
      control the actions of Traveler-Entities. You must make your own choices. '
    npc_nada_nexuscore_wait11: Nada cannot witness Atlas-Falsity, but others in our
      small Convergence can. Nada could understand Atlas-Falsity if Nada chose to.
      Nada does not.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang12: Gek transgressions clear for all to see. But Gek only
      follow rules. All entities conform to their pattern. Gek cannot be blamed. It
      is their pattern. It is determined.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_a12: Ask about the Gek
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_b12: Ask about -null-
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_a12: |-
      Polo-Friend is unlike other Gek. Polo-Friend turns their back on greed and war. But does Polo-Friend make a choice? Do other Gek make a choice? Perhaps Polo-Friend is not good, only anomalous.
      Nada cannot know, and so Nada does not think on it. Polo-Friend is Polo-Friend, and this is sufficient.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_b12: Nada will make you safe if you wish for it, Traveler-Friend.
      That is all Nada can do.<DELAY>0.5<> Missing-Entity wishes for things Nada cannot
      provide, and goes their own way.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_wait12: Nada is grateful for Polo-Friend. Polo-Friend understands
      divergence, though they are not Korvax.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang13: |-
      Missing-Entity is comfortable with danger. Nada is not. Nada chooses their own reality, makes this safe. Our friends are safe.
      But every entity has a pattern. Follow your pattern, following Missing-Entity's pattern, follow Nada's pattern. So it goes.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_a13: Ask about the Atlas
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_a13: |-
      Atlas-Falsity is real. Falsity is in our eyes. Atlas is not deity. Atlas is something else. But Atlas cannot choose how we see its pattern.
      Nada could know more, but Nada chooses not to know more. Missing-Entity believes they know all. Perhaps they do.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_wait13: Nada asks you are careful, Traveler-Friend. You are
      welcome here always.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_wait14: |-
      All must end. Time must end. Even here, Nada and Polo cannot escape reality-fall. Data cannot survive.
      Make peace. Find happiness. Be who you want to be. Goodbye, companions. Goodbye, stars. I will remember.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang15: Is it first? Is it last? Welcome regardless! Traveler-Entity
      is always welcome aboard our home.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_opt_a15: Try to tell Nada about the Atlas
    npc_nada_nexuscore_res_a15: If you have something to tell me, Traveler-Entity,
      Nada chooses not to hear. You are welcome aboard our home. Leave Nada to peace.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_wait15: Nada is always happy to see new eyes for our small
      Convergence. We are happy aboard our home.
    npc_nada_nexuscore_lang16: |-
      Traveler-Friend.
      You remembered us.
      Nada is grateful. For as long as Nada has, Nada will be grateful.
      We will remember you also.
    npc_polo_nexus_catchup_lang: You look surprised, Traveler-Friend. Do you not remember
      Nada or I? You know you are always welcome on our little home!
    npc_polo_nexus_catchup_opt_a: Ask about the Anomaly
    npc_polo_nexus_catchup_res_a: Polo seems confused by my question. They maintain
      this station has always been their home, ever since they first met Nada and
      began its construction.
    npc_polo_a1s3_lang: Exciting, new friend! Exciting! But do speak with Nada. It
      is polite! We may talk after.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_lang1: |-
      Friends everywhere, if only you know where to look. Friends in all shapes, all sizes, all places!
      Artemis-Friend... you are where they should be. Does not seem possible. But, all things are possible. Such is the universe.
      We will find them, no doubt. There is always a signal, always a trace...
    npc_polo_nexuscore_opt_a1: Ask how
    npc_polo_nexuscore_res_a1: |-
      Our home will see to it. When you leave, you will not be where you were. You will be closer.
      Or maybe not. Discovery is exciting, yes?
      Before you leave, perhaps spend some time with other friends? We all help each other here!
    npc_polo_nexuscore_res_b1: |-
      We found you, yes? Just at the wrong time! Our home finds you. That is its purpose.
      Before you leave, perhaps spend some time with other friends? We all help each other here!
    npc_polo_nexuscore_wait1: We were so lonely, Nada and I. Before we found each
      other. Before we found you, friend! All of you! So many friends to share this
      time with. You feel the same, I hope?
    npc_polo_atlaspath_opt: Ask for Atlas Station coordinates
    npc_polo_blackhole_opt: Ask for Black Hole coordinates
    npc_polo_atlaspath_res: I will do it, friend. But please be careful! We would
      hate to see you leave us.
    npc_polo_atlaspath_res2: Polo nods, serious. They send coordinate data for an
      Atlas Station to my starship computer.
    npc_polo_blackhole_res: Of course, friend! A whole galaxy for you, just for you.
      You must see it all!
    npc_polo_blackhole_res2: Polo smiles, and sends the location of a black hole to
      my starship's navigation computer.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_lang2: Nada-Friend guides lost anomalies to our home, makes
      them safe from the Crimson Hunter! Nada is great friend indeed.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_opt_2: Ask about Artemis
    npc_polo_nexuscore_res_2: Perhaps Artemis-Friend has forgotten us. That would
      be sad. Or! I will think that Artemis-Friend has travelled<DELAY>0.3<> somewhere
      when they have not met us yet.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_wait2: We will see Artemis-Friend again sometime, do not fret.
      There is a time where we are all friends.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_lang3: Boundaries are strange things, Traveler-Friend. Most
      things stay where they belong. Other things - our home, Atlas, and now Artemis-Friend
      - slip between. Curious!
    npc_polo_nexuscore_opt_3: Ask about Portals
    npc_polo_nexuscore_res_3: Just devices, Traveler-Friend. To be understood, copied,
      advanced! That is all we can do with this universe, yes? Appreciate it!
    npc_polo_nexuscore_wait3: Might we all fall somewhere strange, like Artemis-Friend?
      Maybe we already have...
    npc_polo_nexuscore_lang4: Nada is alarmed by Apollo-Friend. I am not. It is exciting
      to see where our model fails! If we are wrong, then there are more friends than
      we realized, more friends and more stars!
    npc_polo_nexuscore_opt_4: Ask about Sentinels
    npc_polo_nexuscore_res_4: |-
      Novel Apollo allies himself with the Vy'keen, enjoys to hunt the Sentinels! Good!<DELAY>0.5<> But it will not work.
      They will always come. It is beyond us to change. Everywhere our home has been, the hunters will follow.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_wait4: Talk, read! Study monoliths, if you can find them! Give
      yourself a strong brain to match those strong legs! To explore is to discover
      yourself, friend!
    npc_polo_nexuscore_lang5: |-
      How are you? Are you hungry? This is customary greeting for old friend, yes?
      I told Nada you would be fine, Traveler-Friend! Poor Nada. They do get nervous.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_opt_5: Ask about strange worlds
    npc_polo_nexuscore_res_5: |-
      Once, such places did not exist, could not be seen. But now? Every second more appear. They seep through, a new creation!
      I do not know where these new worlds come from, what lies beyond our boundaries. I do not think I will ever know. But they are exciting to see, yes?
    npc_polo_nexuscore_wait5: You are safe here, Traveler-Friend. Do not worry! Our
      little home seals off the glitches that might harm us.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_lang6: Nada says you have met missing-Friend. Missing-Friend
      did not like me.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_opt_6: Ask about -null-
    npc_polo_nexuscore_res_6: They are not like me or like Nada. They have freedom.
      Like all of you Traveler-friends. But they do not share the sights they see.
      They hoard them. They are jealous. Polo does not approve.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_wait6: You are not like me, friend! You can still go to planets.
      You can still meet new lifeforms, speak, shout, love!
    npc_polo_nexuscore_lang7: |-
      Nada-Friend does not trust the portals. Scared of rampancy, of the Crimson Hunter. But I do not fear in the same way.
      What might we discover, Traveler-Friend? What might we learn from them? They have the same roots as you, as our home, as all this universe.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_opt_7: Ask about fear
    npc_polo_nexuscore_res_7: Nada is scared we may lose our home. I am scared I will
      forget the world outside it.<DELAY>0.4<> Do not let us forget, Traveler-Friend.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_wait7: Do promise to be careful, Traveler-Friend. Portals are
      exciting, discovery is exciting... but come back to us. Do try to always come
      back to us.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_lang8: I miss the dirt, friend, the worlds on which I once
      walked... I miss the sounds of birds and beasts. Even my data, even my recordings
      are gone, as if they had never been...
    npc_polo_nexuscore_opt_8: Ask about Artemis
    npc_polo_nexuscore_res_8: Nada told me about your choice. You are wise. There
      is no easy action for poor Artemis-Friend.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_wait8: All data decays. But our home will give us longer than
      most. Things to be grateful for!
    npc_polo_nexuscore_lang10: Missing-Friend has you do their business. Help if you
      must, but always discover for yourself! Think about what you do, do not just
      follow instructions with your eyes not open!
    npc_polo_nexuscore_opt_10: Ask about the Vy'keen
    npc_polo_nexuscore_res_10: Big grumpy fellows! They do not like friendly little
      Gek.<DELAY>0.6<>. Perhaps they are wise. Like all beings, you will see their
      value if you get to know them.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_wait10: Fight only to survive, friend. Treasure the galaxy
      and all its wonder! You will go far, I am sure of it!
    npc_polo_nexuscore_lang11: Gek are always competitive, always squabble. It is
      not personal. My person is not rejected.<DELAY>0.4<> But Nada... poor Nada suffers.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_opt_11: Ask about the Korvax
    npc_polo_nexuscore_res_11: |-
      Their kind expect harmony, unity. Nada sees in a way they do not see, and so they reject poor Nada.
      Convergence was bought at a great cost. They will fight to maintain it. Anomalies are cast aside, the necessary sacrifice.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_wait11: I think Atlas-Being is a convergence of sorts. This
      is why the Korvax fear it.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_lang12: Do you learn about all our origins, Traveler-Friend?
      Great mysteries, deep patterns, Gek, Korvax, Vy'keen, Sentinel... All are rooted
      somewhere.<DELAY>0.4<> Have you clues to your own beginnings? The strangest
      puzzle!
    npc_polo_nexuscore_opt_12: Ask about other Gek
    npc_polo_nexuscore_res_12: We are <DELAY>0.3<>all<DELAY>0.2<> a funny sort, Traveler-Friend.
      Some are angry, some are greedy, some are dear friends. I will wait my whole
      life to see what I am.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_wait12: Nada-Friend was enough for me for many years. Now I
      have so many friends! They are my new spawn-family.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_lang13: I have always wanted to know more. To discover is joy!
      But now I wonder... perhaps some things I should not discover. Nada may be right.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_opt_13: Ask about anomalies
    npc_polo_nexuscore_res_13: |-
      We are all anomalies here. We should not exist. And yet, we do. Joy!
      But something is different. Were we always this many? No? I cannot remember. Is more anomalies good?
      More friends - good! More to discover - good! More thinking - good! It seems so. But still I wonder...
    npc_polo_nexuscore_wait13: The stars are hardened, friend. We must find out why.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_lang14: |-
      Will I know, Traveler-Friend, when it happens?
      I suppose it may have happened before, already, again and again. Do you know if it has? I suppose you must not.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_wait14: Always be kind, Traveler-Friend. Always discover. I
      will miss you.
    npc_polo_nexuscore_help_res_14: Of course. But do not delay on our account, friend.

      You want to know me? I am like you, and also not like you. I am a Traveler, yet linger in this place between places, where none truly belong.

    fth_exotic4_opt_a_3: Smell them
    fth_exotic4_opt_b_3: Stare at them
    fth_exotic4_res_3: Tethys looks uncomfortable, their pulse visible in their throat.
    fth_exotic4_lang_4: Alright! Fine. Look, I admit it. I'm not a Gek. I'm just another
      Traveler, passing through.
    fth_exotic4_opt_a_4: Ask why they're here
    fth_exotic4_opt_b_4: Ask why they lied
    fth_exotic4_res_4: Tethys hesitates.
    fth_exotic4_lang_5: Have you ever crossed paths with the Sentinels who patrol
      most of the worlds out there?
    fth_exotic4_opt_a_5: Say you have
    fth_exotic4_opt_b_5: Say you have not
    fth_exotic4_res_a_5: |-
      Then you know what it's like to be hunted by them.
      Suffice to say the Sentinels and I had a conflict of interest. And now, it's in my interest to lay low here.
    fth_exotic4_res_b_5: |-
      Then you've been fortunate. I see what you're carrying in your pack. There's no way you got this far without raising a mining laser to some of the resources this universe has to offer.
      Suffice to say the Sentinels and I had a conflict of interest. And now, it's in my interest to lay low here.
    fth_exotic4_lang_daily1: |-
      If you wish to, perhaps we might strike back against the Sentinel menace.
      Fell one of their infernal Walkers, harvest their brains. We will win back our peace.
    fth_exotic4_opt_daily1: Present Walker Brain
    fth_exotic4_res_daily1: A glorious trophy. You have done well!
    fth_exotic4_wait_daily1: Soon, we will triumph. Soon, I will be free, free from
      the robotic plague...
    fth_exotic5_wait: Greetings, kindred. Again, impossibly, we meet in the flesh.
    fth_exotic5_wait2: Greetings, kindred. Our paths may have splintered out into
      infinite variations, infinite trials, but they all loop home eventually.
    fth_exotic5_wait_opt_a: Touch their shoulder
    fth_exotic5_wait_res_a: Hesperus glances down at the contact, seeming reassured
      by it. They nod, grateful, momentarily at peace.
    fth_exotic5_lang_1: Salutations.
    fth_exotic5_desc_1: The sharp-eyed being stares at me, unblinking. They tell me
      their name - Hesperus - but rush through the words, as though nuisanced by the
      introduction. Their focus is on me.
    fth_exotic5_lang_1b: Tell me, stranger. Who exactly are you? A wanderer? A Traveler?
    fth_exotic5_opt_a_1: Say you are a wanderer
    fth_exotic5_opt_b_1: Say you are a Traveler
    fth_exotic5_opt_c_1: Say you don't know
    fth_exotic5_res_a_1: Hesperus exhales audibly.
    fth_exotic5_res_a_1b: Perhaps you have not yet heard the call. It will become
      irresistible, eventually. You begin to hear it in your dreams, in your heartbeat.
      <MOOD>Sad<>Even after... even afterwards.
    fth_exotic5_res_a_1c: There is a sudden movement from the other lifeform stood
      at Hesperus' side. <MOOD>Neutral<>Hesperus clears their throat.
    fth_exotic5_res_a_1d: I believe we tread parallel paths, you and I. And yet, quite
      impossibly, we have met. Let us not make this our only encounter.
    fth_exotic5_res_b_1: Hesperus' moustache quivers when I mirror the term they have
      chosen. 'Traveler'. The word hangs in the air.
    fth_exotic5_res_b_1b: I believe we tread parallel paths, you and I. And yet, quite
      impossibly, we have met. Let us not make this our only encounter.
    fth_exotic5_lang_daily1: In one of our cycles, we exchanged gifts. The time has
      come to do so again. Take this. Perhaps your future self requires it.
    fth_exotic5_res_daily1: Enjoy. You will return this favor one day.
    fth_exotic5_wait_daily1: Until our next iteration, kindred.
    fth_nexuschef_desc_1: The lifeform sniffs at me with a derisory look, trying to
      detect the items I carry from scent alone.
    fth_nexuschef_lang_1: Well? Do not simply stand there! Do I look as if I have
      time to waste? Show me what you have!
    fth_nexuschef_lang_2: Offer me your work, and I shall offer you my opinions. I
      promise I shall be honest.<MOOD>Negative<> I do not promise you will be pleased.

      You, and your %ITEM%, have earned my respect!
    fth_nexuschef_res_ave1: Hmm... a largely unremarkable %ITEM%, though there are
      some small signs of finesse, some hint of future promise...
    fth_nexuschef_res_ave2: Well... You have created the most average %ITEM% imaginable.
      Quite some achievement.
    fth_nexuschef_res_ave3: |-

      Acceptable. Technically, this is %ITEM%. But it does not move me.
    fth_nexuschef_res_ave4: |-
      %ITEM%? Perhaps.
      But the primary sensation is not taste. It is blandness. Utter blandness.
    fth_nexuschef_res_bad1: This... this is not %ITEM%.<MOOD>Negative<> This is as
      near to %ITEM% as my tongue is to a plank!
    fth_nexuschef_res_bad2: "<MOOD>Negative<>I know this is %ITEM%, but the primary
      sensation is of utter blandness."
    fth_nexuschef_res_bad3: "<MOOD>Negative<>You dare to call this %ITEM%? Pah!"
    fth_nexuschef_res_bad4: I do not know what to tell you.<MOOD>Negative<> I did
      not gag. That is the only positive of this %ITEM%.
    fth_nexuschef_res_worst1: "<MOOD>Negative<>Filth! Tripe! Rot! My tongue shudders
      at this monstrosity!"
    fth_nexuschef_res_worst2: "... \n<MOOD>Negative<>I do not believe anything more
      unpleasant has ever passed my lips. How did you ruin %ITEM% so?"
    fth_nexuschef_res_worst3: I... <MOOD>Negative<>I have eaten your %ITEM%. I have
      never regretted anything more.

      stars. Let me tend to yours.
    fth_exotic_shipshop2: We shall fly together, my work upon your wings, soaring
      across the skies!
    fth_exotic_shipshop3: Wings of gold and glory, friend! There is no end to the
      stars!
    fth_exotic_suitshop1: I heard whisper of your arrival, Traveler-new. I heard the
      singing of the drones, their clipped voices speaking in unison of a fresh anomaly.
      I will aid you.
    fth_exotic_suitshop2: Traveler-new, your suit is an extension of yourself. Let
      me aid you.
    fth_exotic_weapshop1: Yes? Multi-Tools? Yes? So many Multi-Tools. Make them better.
      Faster! Make them more!
    fth_exotic_weapshop2: More power. Stronger. Faster. Sharper. Sharper. Polished,
      refined, sharpened with nanites...
    fth_exotic_vehshop1: Specialist Polo is teaching me much! Crafting engines, smoothing
      pistons, the atomic sharpness of the finest gears! All shaped from the nanite
      foam. Glorious to learn their art, yes?
    fth_exotic_vehshop2: Work together, my friend! Always a new gear to turn!

    dnt_tra_crashsite_lang_1: Friend! Ship crashed. I am stranded here alone. Will
      you help unhappy Gek?
    tra_crashsite_desc_1: This Gek seems to look directly into the core of me, their
      eyes large and imploring. They gesture sadly towards the crash nearby. I feel
      guilty for every moment I delay helping them...
    tra_crashsite_opt_a_1: Offer assistance

      to my hands. I am faintly aware of a rewarding fragrance teasing my nostrils."
    tra_crashsite_ship_desc_1: The damage to the starship is surprisingly minimal
      - it is in good condition save for a buckled launch thruster. Nonetheless, I
      sense the Gek's anxiety. The compulsion to help them is overwhelming...
    tra_crashsite_ship_opt_a_1: Repair thruster
    tra_crashsite_ship_res_a_1: The repair job is trivial - well within the capabilities
      of any starship pilot. I begin to question the sincerity of the Gek's helplessness,
      but my mind feels strangely clouded.
    tra_crashsite_ret_desc_1: Realizing I am done, the trader shrieks with delight,
      their mood instantly brightening. They clutch my hand in both of theirs and
      thank me with a generous gift.
    dnt_tra_crashsite_lang_2: Hello friend! I am not a foolish Gek, not workshy! I
      can repair ship. But pain... cannot repair myself...
    tra_crashsite_desc_2: This Gek looks to have been violently thrown from the ship
      crashed nearby, and injured as a result. They clutch at their right wrist, the
      hand hanging loosely.
    tra_crashsite_opt_a_2: Improvise splint
    tra_crashsite_res_a_2: I reinforce the Gek's shattered joint as best I can, hoping
      this will function as a splint until they next access a Health Station. They
      flex their fingers, wincing, and thank me with a gift.
    dnt_tra_crashsite_lang_3: Take pity, friend... my ship broke. Too many Units to
      repair!
    tra_crashsite_desc_3: This Gek appears to have been stranded, their starship smoking
      and land-locked. They shrug, wide-eyed and innocent, indicating the faulty navigation
      gimbal that drove them into the dirt.
    tra_crashsite_opt_a_3: Offer assistance
    tra_crashsite_res_a_3: "%NAME% looks pleased. Their eyes shift pointedly between
      me and the crash."
    tra_crashsite_ship_desc_3: 'A cursory glance at the ship''s battered components
      is revealing: this ship has been poorly maintained, the various subsystems simply
      wearing out to the point of failure. Some parts look more than a decade old.'

    tra_crashsite_ship_opt_b_3: Perform deeper repair
    tra_crashsite_ship_res_a_3: These starship parts are in such a state that any
      repairs are bound to be temporary. I attend to the crucial subsystems, patching
      them up solidly enough to stave off any imminent flight disasters.
    tra_crashsite_ship_res_b_3: Any repairs to this starship won't last long without
      addressing the blown-out navigation circuitry. I fit an expensive new microprocessor,
      and patch up the surrounding components.

      I try to press the importance of good starship upkeep to %NAME%, but it seems they cannot - or will not - understand me.

      Stole valuable cargo, important delivery. Help find culprit? Valuable reward!
    tra_crashsite_desc_4: |-
      The Gek grabs a lone battered crate from their crashed starship, opening it to show me a cache of valuables. I sense that their original shipment included many more crates of this nature.
      Gesturing broadly to compensate for the gaps in our communication, they indicate that they would be willing to trade some of their stash in return for finding the attackers who stole from them...
    tra_crashsite_opt_a_4: Accept
    tra_crashsite_opt_b_4: Refuse
    tra_crashsite_res_a_4: |-
      The Gek looks overwhelmed, a sudden involuntary aroma wrapping me in warmth and gratitude.
      They access their ship's logs to show me some brief, corrupted footage of pirates descending on their vessel with phase beam fire.
      As the video feed flickers and dies, the Gek points to the sky, gently urging me onwards.
    tra_crashsite_res_b_4: The Gek seems taken aback by my refusal, again showing
      me the valuable cargo they have for trade. They sigh as I take my leave.
    tra_crashsite_wait_4: "%NAME% shifts their weight nervously. They await news of
      retribution against the pirates who ransacked their ship."
    tra_crashsite_ret_desc_4: "%NAME% looks me over, pleased to see all my limbs intact
      following my pirate battle."
    dnt_tra_crashsite_lang_5: Hello! You are trustworthy friend, yes? Cargo lost in
      confiscation... maybe some is illegal... but rare, special!
    tra_crashsite_desc_5: |-
      The Gek points out the scorch marks streaking their ship, and the empty inventory hold. They speak in hushed tones, looking around nervously, as though they half expect some authority to suddenly descend on them.
      They produce what initially looks to be an ordinary fuel cell. Furtively, they hinge open the casing to reveal a new Multi-Tool, clearly stamped with Vy'keen insignia.
      Snapping the casing closed, they gesture back at the empty hold, where presumably more of these smuggled treasures were stowed...
    tra_crashsite_opt_a_5: Offer to retrieve goods
    tra_crashsite_opt_b_5: Report to authorities
    tra_crashsite_res_a_5: "%NAME% bounces on their toes in delight. They direct me
      to the facility where they first lifted the stash, cautioning me against the

    tra_crashsite_res_b_5: |-
      Before the pirate trader has time to react, I transmit a crime report to the system authorities. Dismay and betrayal washes across their face.
      A representative from the Gek Trade Federation appears on my visor, an elaborate beak modification showcasing their high rank. In customary Gek fashion, they offer their thanks with units.
    tra_crashsite_wait_5: "%NAME% shifts their weight nervously. They await news of
      my infiltration of the secure facility."
    tra_crashsite_ret_opt_a_5: Share coordinates
    tra_crashsite_ret_res_a_5: The Gek thanks me warmly, almost seeming to have expected
      new coordinates. As they offer the promised Multi-Tool, their eyes dart guiltily
      over my Exosuit, checking for injury.
    tra_crashsite_ret2_opt_a_5: Accept Multi-Tool reward
    tra_crashsite_ret2_opt_b_5: Request units instead
    tra_crashsite_fact_desc_5: It appears that the Multi-Tool cache has been relocated
      to a new vault. The pirate Gek will likely be appreciative of these new coordinates.

    dnt_tra_crashsite_lang_6: My new mining ship! I paid so many units for this starship...
      stupid purchase... now crashed and ruined!
    tra_crashsite_desc_6: This Gek appears to be taking stock of their starship's
      cargo after a crash. They wring their hands and pace ineffectually, wavering
      between helplessness and embarrassment, both wanting help and not wanting it.
    tra_crashsite_opt_a_6: Offer assistance
    tra_crashsite_opt_b_6: Ask about crash
    tra_crashsite_res_a_6: "%NAME%'s internal conflict seems to dissolve. They look
      unburdened. Suddenly remembering themselves, they give a dignified sniff, and
      indicate that they do, of course, have the means to pay for my assistance."
    tra_crashsite_res_b_6: The Gek cringes. They awkwardly communicate that this starship
      was either a very recent acquisition, or borrowed. Either way, the ship's handling
      was unfamiliar to them. The crash was the simple result of poor piloting.
    tra_crashsite_ship_desc_6: This looks like a brand new starship, only recently
      certified for flight. The regrettable denting to the nose tells the story of
      direct collision with an asteroid. The mineral dust on the weapon barrels suggests
      some enthusiastic mining may have preceded the crash.
    tra_crashsite_ship_opt_a_6: Repair ship
    tra_crashsite_ret_desc_6: "%NAME% looks much more composed now their ship is restored.
      They ready their accounts to transfer my payment..."
    tra_crashsite_ret_opt_a_6: Accept units
    tra_crashsite_ret_opt_b_6: Request cargo payment
    tra_crashsite_ret_res_a_6: The Gek seems happy to part with their units. They
      wave farewell, ready to continue their journey.
    tra_crashsite_ret_res_b_6: The Gek's face drops slightly, reluctant to give up
      their cargo. However, they seem to accept the fairness of the trade, and hand
      over a reasonable portion of minerals. They wave farewell, ready to continue
      their journey.
    dnt_tra_crashsite_lang_7: Friend! Ship fall from flight, I do not know why!
    tra_crashsite_desc_7: The Gek seems frustrated, cursing to themselves. The nearby
      ship, driven into the dirt by an unexpected landing, must belong to them.
    tra_crashsite_opt_a_7: Offer assistance
    tra_crashsite_opt_b_7: Mock their plight
    tra_crashsite_res_a_7: "%NAME% looks skeptical, but nods. I have permission to
      investigate the crash."
    tra_crashsite_res_b_7: "%NAME%'s irritation escalates. They wave me away."
    tra_crashsite_ship_desc_7: The ship's engine seems an appropriate fit for a vessel
      of this size - and yet it has failed from overextension, now sparking in protest.
      The starship must be far heavier than it appears...
    tra_crashsite_ship_opt_a_7: Repair engine
    tra_crashsite_ship_opt_b_7: Relieve cargo first
    tra_crashsite_ship_res_a_7: I manipulate the engine by hand, manually guiding
      the parts until they move smoothly again. The movements come naturally, as though
      I've performed them many times before.
    tra_crashsite_ship_res_b_7: I take a quick look in the cargo hold, and find it
      overloaded with dense minerals, weighing the ship down far beyond reasonable
      capacity. Adding some of the haul to my own pack lightens the ship's load.
    tra_crashsite_ret_desc_a_7: "%NAME% is thrilled to have their ship back in business,
      rewarding me generously. But their cargo hold is still overburdened, and I do
      not have faith in the long-term survival of their engine..."
    tra_crashsite_ret_desc_b_7: "%NAME% evidently noticed the cargo being lifted from
      their hold, as they greet me somewhat coldly. They transfer a low sum of units,
      and wave a sarcastic farewell."
    tra_crashsite_ret_opt_a_7: Wave farewell
    dnt_tra_crashsite_lang_8: I did not take! Equipment is mine, purchased with savings!
      Please do not report.
    tra_crashsite_desc_8: This Gek is shifting their weight back and forth, their
      eyes darting rapidly between me and the crashed ship. I notice an object in
      their hands, which they hurriedly conceal.
    tra_crashsite_opt_a_8: Demand object
    tra_crashsite_opt_b_8: Let them go
    tra_crashsite_res_a_8: With a squeal, the Gek pushes the equipment into my hands,
      apparently too nervous to bargain or protest. Their eyes stay fixed on me until
      they are certain I am gone.
    tra_crashsite_res_b_8: The Gek giggles nervously, gifting me Units when they realize
      I don't intend to interfere with their looting. Their eyes stay fixed on me
      until they are certain I am gone.
    tra_crashsite_done_8: The scavenging Gek freezes when they see me again. They
      stare, waiting for me to leave.
    dnt_tra_scavenger_lang_1: Hello! Let me charge suit for friend! No units required,
      just love, so much love! Good for soul!
    tra_scavenger_hot_desc_1: This Gek is happily trotting around the exposed terrain,
      almost taking pleasure in the baking heat. They seem excited to greet me, and,
      for their own inscrutable reasons, freely recharge my hazard protection.
    tra_scavenger_cold_desc_1: This Gek is happily trotting around the exposed terrain,
      apparently oblivious to the biting cold. They seem excited to greet me, and,

      apparently oblivious to the heavy radiation. They seem excited to greet me,
      and, for their own inscrutable reasons, freely recharge my hazard protection.
    tra_scavenger_opt_a_1: Leave with thanks

      Unexpected luck with mining. Happy, happy, happy to share!

      The Gek must have been out here a long time. The dry red earth that flecks their Exosuit and Multi-Tool indicates long hours of mining, yet they seem in high spirits.

    tra_scavenger_opt_a_3: Offer directions
    tra_scavenger_res_a_3: The Gek seizes the navigation data, examining the decrypted
      output with relief. Apparently their immediate dilemma is resolved, but they
      do not set off to leave. Gratefully, they reward me, but then bury their face
      in their datapad. Perhaps they have other unfinished business here.

      The Gek starts to make a lunge for me, then catches themselves awkwardly. They have the primal, savage look of someone starved to the point of violence.
      <MOOD>Sad<>Desperate to communicate, they mime a shape in the air. It bears a strange resemblance to the symbol for units...
    tra_scavenger_opt_a_4: Give units
    tra_scavenger_opt_b_4: Give nutrients from Exosuit
    tra_scavenger_opt_c_4: Tell them off
    tra_scavenger_res_a_4: As the units hit the Gek's account, relief visibly washes
      over them, swiftly followed by embarrassment. They clear their throat.
    tra_scavenger_res_b_4: The Gek lets out a single, raw scream of frustration -
      then seems to regain control of themselves. They look embarrassed. They have
      been away from civilization for a while now.
    tra_scavenger_res_c_4: Indignant rage flares in the Gek's eyes, swiftly followed
      by shame. They apologize, then apologize for apologizing, then snap their beak
      firmly closed.
    tra_scavenger_desc2_4: There is an awkward silence.
    tra_scavenger_opt_d_4: Ask about area
    tra_scavenger_res_d_4: |-
      Keen to move on from their outburst, the Gek enthusiastically shares the data that led them to this site.
      Historical records indicate that, during the height of the First Spawn empire, a Korvax enslaved on this planet managed to flee their captivity. They made it this far before all trace of them vanished.
      %NAME% is convinced that this escape - unprecedented at the time - is significant to Gek history. The Korvax in question must have left something important in the damaged machinery here. If only it could be opened!
    tra_scavenger_debris_4: A shrill alarm rings out as I approach the strange pod.

      even louder. The device seems specifically wired to repel biological lifeforms.
    tra_scavenger_debris_res_b_4: The device pings softly in response to the AtlasPass.
      The alarm is overridden, and the pod's contents are released.
    tra_scavenger_debris_res_c_4: |-
      In a dangerous gamble, I take a deep breath, hold it, and disable my Exosuit's life support systems. I touch my hand to the display, hoping my vital signs will be sufficiently cloaked.
      It is enough to fool the ancient technology. The device pings softly, and its contents are released. I hurriedly re-enable my life support.
    tra_scavenger_ret_desc_4: "%NAME%'s ravenous look returns tenfold when they see
      the carapace in my hands. They dribble slightly, their fingers twitching. There
      is something foreboding about their overwhelming desire for it."

    tra_scavenger_ret_opt_b_4: Keep carapace
    tra_scavenger_ret_res_a_4: |-
      A sinister giggle bursts from the Gek as they snatch the carapace. In trade, they present me with a substantial sum of Nanite Clusters. The Nanites almost seem to wriggle away from the Gek's grasp.
      %NAME% dismisses me.
    tra_scavenger_ret_res_b_4: The Gek looks downright furious to see the carapace
      packed away. The small lifeform's unbridled emotion is intimidating. I can't
      help but feel this carapace would be safer in any other hands.
    dnt_tra_scavenger_lang_5: Look together with me, friend. Do not speak. Just look.

    tra_scavenger_opt_b_5: Gaze with them

      the sky. To them, the answer is self-evident.

      Together we stare out at the landscape. There is a beauty to the scorched earth of this world, the leathery flora soaking up the heat.

    tra_scavenger_desc_6: |-
      The Gek stares in surprise, unsure of who or what I am, and why I am out here. I notice them toying with a small object, turning it between their fingertips. A greedy look creeps into their eyes.
      <MOOD>Neutral<>Suddenly, the greedy look subsides. They press the small object into my hands, closing my fingers around it. A gift. Their impulse to trade is strong, but they are not without empathy for a lost friend.

      late. So many units...
    tra_walkabout_desc_3: The trader seems glad to be waylaid. Wherever they are heading,
      their feet drag with heavy misgiving.
    tra_walkabout_opt_a_3: Comfort
    tra_walkabout_opt_b_3: Leave alone
    tra_walkabout_res_a_3: I smile at the Gek and pat their shoulder encouragingly,
      but they continue to look depressed.
    tra_walkabout_res_b_3: The Gek sighs as they realize I have no diversion to offer
      from whatever task they are dreading. They shuffle on.
    dnt_tra_walkabout_lang_4: Friend, hello! Did we already meet? Hard to remember.
      Was I here today? Yesterday? I know I have somewhere to be... I think... always
      going somewhere, every day the same...
    tra_walkabout_desc_4: The Gek looks troubled as I stop them in their path. They
      rub their beak and close their eyes for a moment, as though trying to recall
      something...
    tra_walkabout_opt_a_4: Shout
    tra_walkabout_opt_b_4: Tiptoe away
    tra_walkabout_res_a_4: I shout at the trader, and their eyes snap open immediately.
      They look at me suspiciously, squinting as though not quite sure whether I am
      real. For a moment I think they mean to reach out and touch me - but then they
      seem to remember themselves, and carry on.
    tra_walkabout_res_b_4: I step away slowly. When the Gek re-opens their eyes, they
      resume their path immediately. It is as though our exchange never happened.
    dnt_tra_walkabout_lang_5: A traveller friend! Are you a rich traveller maybe?
      Many units in account?
    tra_walkabout_desc_5: The Gek comes to a stop and looks at me curiously, their
      eyes keen and piercing. I notice they have a hand at their hip, and then I notice
      they are discreetly running a scanner over my Exosuit.
    tra_walkabout_opt_a_5: Protest
    tra_walkabout_opt_b_5: Leave
    tra_walkabout_res_a_5: Caught out, the Gek shrugs openly and glance down at the
      scanner's display. They make a private note and throw me one final inscrutable
      look as they walk away.
    tra_walkabout_res_b_5: I leave quickly, suspecting this Gek may not have my best
      interests at heart.
    dnt_tra_walkabout_lang_6: Legs are small, I know... walk is not quick. Are you
      here to laugh too?
    tra_walkabout_desc_6: This Gek seems to be shyly asking for an outside opinion
      on something. They shrink into themselves awkwardly, almost as though they don't
      want to be seen.
    tra_walkabout_opt_a_6: Reassure
    tra_walkabout_opt_b_6: Laugh at their tiny legs
    tra_walkabout_res_a_6: The Gek recognizes my universal gestures of reassurance
      and squawks out a few happy notes. They carry on with their business, now with
      a slight spring to their gait.
    tra_walkabout_res_b_6: I seem to have hit upon the exact point of the Gek's insecurity.
      They look more dejected than before, and quickly move away from me.
    dnt_tra_walkabout_lang_7: Be quick, be fast! I am busy Gek!
    tra_walkabout_desc_7: The Gek looks over me impatiently, waiting to see if I have
      anything to say.
    tra_walkabout_opt_a_7: Delay them further
    tra_walkabout_opt_b_7: Leave them be
    tra_walkabout_res_a_7: Sensing that I have nothing of interest to say, the Gek
      waves me away in irritation and carries on.
    tra_walkabout_res_b_7: Huffing slightly at the pointless interruption, the Gek
      carries on with their business.
    dnt_tra_walkabout_lang_8: Hello stranger friend! So happy to add to friend collection!
      Universe is sometimes large and lonely.
    tra_walkabout_desc_8: This Gek was clearly headed somewhere, but they turn towards
      me with a playful trill as I wave them down. They appear curious about me, poised
      to see what I'll do next.
    tra_walkabout_opt_a_8: Impress with Multi-Tool
    tra_walkabout_opt_b_8: Impress with Units
    tra_walkabout_res_a_8: The Gek pores over the various attachments to my Multi-Tool
      in fascination. I get the impression they are assessing my choices rather than
      the product itself. Eventually they nod to themselves in solemn satisfaction,
      and move along.
    tra_walkabout_res_b_8: The Gek dissolves into fits of giggles as they review the
      figures in my account. Several times, they attempt to speak, but fail as they
      succumb to another wave of mirth. They thank me - for what, I'm not sure - and
      carry on to wherever they were headed.
    tra_filler_desc_21: I catch sight of this Gek leaning towards me as I pass, their
      tongue extended and quivering. Our eyes meet, and they withdraw their tongue
      with a flick. We stare at each other awkwardly.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_21: Fascinating scent! Exotic like Traveller...
    tra_filler_opt_a_21: Sniff
    tra_filler_opt_b_21: Threaten
    tra_filler_res_a_21: I inhale deeply. %NAME% responds by releasing a peculiar
      - yet intimately familiar - smell. They look pleased with themselves. I leave,
      feeling self-conscious.
    tra_filler_res_b_21: I place my hand on my Multi-Tool and fix the Gek with a stern
      look. They squeal in alarm.
    tra_request_text_41: "%NAME% inhales deeply, clearing the air of their scent.
      They wait, expectantly."
    tra_filler_desc_22: This squat lifeform looks agitated. They wave a datapad in
      my face. On the screen of the device, I see what looks like an expired auction
      listing. A hyperdrive upgrade has just been sold for a bargain price.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_22: No, no, no! No, sneaky trader! I saw first!
    tra_filler_opt_a_22: Cheer them up
    tra_filler_opt_b_22: Laugh
    tra_filler_res_a_22: I try to distract %NAME%. They dismiss me impatiently - but
      seem slightly less distressed nonetheless.
    tra_filler_res_b_22: The Gek looks deeply ashamed, as though they have failed
      in some essential task. They refuse to interact with me further.
    tra_request_text_42: "%NAME% chirps and squeaks. The prospect of a fresh transaction
      has cheered them."
    tra_filler_desc_23: I am certain I do not know this Gek, yet meeting them now,
      I am overwhelmed with a sudden affection. A wave of bittersweet nostalgia sweeps
      over me.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_23: Hello friend! Do you remember great friend Gek?
    tra_filler_opt_a_23: Embrace them
    tra_filler_opt_b_23: Hold breath
    tra_filler_res_a_23: I enfold the Gek in a hug that lasts for several minutes.
      I feel profoundly safe and tranquil, as though together, we could overcome anything.
      They look giddy when I finally step away.
    tra_filler_res_b_23: I hold my breath to avoid inhaling %NAME%'s pheromones. The
      sense of familiarity soon abates, confirming my suspicions.
    tra_request_text_43: "%NAME% will help me, I am certain. We will be united in
      a glorious transaction."
    tra_filler_desc_24: This Gek is shouting into their earpiece, their tone irritated
      and self-important. They seem to be unhappy about some business deal that has
      transpired.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_24: Stupid SalesGek! I said this would not do! Deal is bad.
      Profit high but customer lost. Tell no! Wasting time!
    tra_filler_opt_a_24: Politely ask them to be quiet
    tra_filler_opt_b_24: Cough
    tra_filler_res_a_24: I try to catch the Gek's attention, but they wave me away
      dismissively.
    tra_filler_res_b_24: I cough pointedly, but the Gek completely ignores me.
    tra_request_text_44: "%NAME% ends their communication with an angry snapping of
      their beak. They look at me, impatient."
    tra_filler_desc_25: The Gek is operating a datapad at a frenetic pace. They seem
      to be struggling to compose a message, entering and then deleting swathes of
      text with equal fury.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_25: 'I already paid! Federation is wrong, new regulations
      are scam! '
    tra_filler_opt_a_25: Look at datapad screen
    tra_filler_opt_b_25: Leave them alone
    tra_filler_res_a_25: I peer over the Gek's shoulder, trying to read the message,
      but am unable to decipher the language. They cast me an irritated look and pull
      the device away from view.
    tra_filler_res_b_25: The Gek seems busy. I let them get on with their business.
    tra_request_text_45: "%NAME% mutters at me, expecting sympathy. I compose my request."
    tra_filler_desc_26: The Gek retrieves a morsel from their pockets. It is some
      sort of grey entrail, a short tube stuffed with oily clumps of vegetative matter.
      They nod encouragingly and mime an eating gesture.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_26: Hello stranger friend! I have new product here, soon coming
      to market. Want to try?
    tra_filler_opt_a_26: Try one
    tra_filler_opt_b_26: Refuse
    tra_filler_res_a_26: |-
      With some apprehension, I accept the slimy object and taste it. To my relief, it melts a glorious medley of flavors onto my tongue, both complex and comforting, like nothing I've ever eaten before.
      %NAME% watches my reaction and makes several notes, looking pleased.
    tra_filler_res_b_26: "%NAME% seems unwilling to accept my refusal, continuing
      to nod and thrust their unappetizing snack towards me. I hurriedly retreat from
      the situation."
    tra_request_text_46: "%NAME% waits. They seem hopeful I will take their strange
      sample as part of a trade deal."
    tra_filler_desc_27: 'This strange lifeform seems agitated. The air surrounding
      them shifts repeatedly between two distinct aromas: one evoking a sunny afternoon;
      the other a crisp snowy night.'
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_27: Hello friend! Help me? Which smell to impress new spawning
      partner?
    tra_filler_opt_a_27: Choose sunny scent
    tra_filler_opt_b_27: Choose frosty scent
    tra_filler_res_a_27: The perfume surrounding the Gek intensifies. It relaxes me,
      conjuring memories of warm grass, chirping insects, soft sunlight. The Gek thanks
      me, apparently relieved to have made a decision.
    tra_filler_res_b_27: The perfume surrounding the Gek intensifies. It intrigues
      me, conjuring images of moonlight and mystery, frosty trees, swirling fog. The
      Gek thanks me, apparently relieved to have made a decision.
    tra_request_text_47: "%NAME% looks puzzled, upset that my mind is not focused
      on scent."
    tra_filler_desc_28: "%NAME% thrusts a datapad towards me as I approach, a cloud
      of cloying perfume billowing from their scent gland. On the screen is an image
      of the Gek, alongside what looks like a complicated ranking system. The calculated
      value does not look high."
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_28: Score with Gek Trade Federation is low! Please offer high
      approval, increase rank?
    tra_filler_opt_a_28: Enter high value
    tra_filler_opt_b_28: Enter low value
    tra_filler_res_a_28: I submit a high rating to the system, but the numbers do
      not seem to improve. Looking increasingly worried, they resume their previous
      task.
    tra_filler_res_b_28: With a cry of dismay, the Gek snatches away the datapad before
      I can submit the low score. They pull it close to their chest and dismiss me
      with a glare.
    tra_request_text_48: "%NAME% chirps happily. They click at the datapad and prepare
      their goods for inspection."
    tra_filler_desc_29: This Gek is preoccupied with a screen of numbers. As they
      tap at it, vast sums move from one account to another, though the transfers
      have no obvious purpose. The little trader seems to derive great pleasure simply
      from watching the numbers flow, humming to themselves.
    dnt_tra_filler_lang_29: Up and down, high and low! Supervisor profits are magnificence,
      ToilGek do good work!
    tra_filler_opt_a_29: Hum along
    tra_filler_opt_b_29: Leave
    tra_filler_res_a_29: I hum along with the Gek, joining them in watching the wealth
      trickle between accounts. Together, we glory in the thrill of a business enterprise
      that spans continents, planets, star systems, with infinite growth prospects.
      I step away feeling lightheaded.
    tra_filler_res_b_29: I leave, avoiding getting wrapped up in this strange ritual.
    tra_request_text_49: "%NAME% looks surprised at the prospect of a genuine transaction.
      They compose themselves to listen to my request."
    tra_npc_hot_desc_2: |-
      The Gek is breathing heavily, their hands covered in soil. Several dirt-encrusted rocks, wrapped in pale broad-leafed foliage, litter the floor around them.
      Turning their bloodshot eyes towards me, they indicate the strange rocks, and the scorched landscape outside. I gather that they are <STELLAR>asking for my assistance<>...
    dnt_tra_npc_hot_lang_2: So tired. So hot. Shard plants are profitable commerce,
      rare, not found elsewhere! But so hot outside...
    tra_npc_hot_opt_a_2: Offer botanical assistance
    tra_npc_hot_opt_b_2: Leave
    tra_npc_hot_res_a_2: The Gek seems grateful for my assistance. As they turn to
      shake my hand, I notice a fetid-smelling oil rolling down their beak and pooling
      unpleasantly on the floor. I decide to avoid the handshake.
    tra_npc_hot_res_b_2: The Gek looks as though they might cry, but no moisture forms
      in their eyes.
    tra_npc_hot_farm_ret: |-
      Even inside a heat-regulated facility, %NAME% seems to be suffering from this planet's climate. They cough dryly, releasing an extra burst of rotten-smelling pheromone.
      They turn their cloudy eyes toward me, forcing a smile. With the requested samples, they will be able to establish their Solanium farm here.
    tra_npc_hot_farm_ret_opt_a: Give samples
    tra_npc_hot_farm_ret_res_a: |-
      %NAME% immediately seems healthier. Perhaps it is the anticipation of profit.
      Using a specialized device, they strip the leaves and chaff from the Solanium. Only the bulb remains, oddly spongy to the touch. They hand it to me, ready to be planted.
    tra_npc_hot_farm_ret_opt_b: Withhold samples
    tra_npc_hot_farm_ret_res_b: |-
      %NAME%'s health is obviously declining here. Establishing a farm in this climate is likely to eventually kill them. I try to convey my concern, gesturing towards the sickly oil weeping from their scales.
      They look panicked, their gaze locked on the Solanium cuttings. They indicate that if I withhold these, they will be forced to collect more samples themselves, out in the heat. Nothing will dissuade them from this plan.
    tra_npc_hot_farm_ret_res_c: I resolutely pack away the Solanium cuttings. %NAME%
      looks totally crushed.
    tra_npc_hot_desc_3: |-
      %NAME% beckons, as though wishing to entrust me with some important task. They are in a merry mood, despite appearing to suffer from some minor physical discomfort. They rub frequently at their rounded belly.
      Showing me a sprig of fireberry that grows natively on this planet, they indicate that they would part with precious units in return for a greater sample...
    dnt_tra_npc_hot_lang_3: Temperature here is excellent! Great opportunity for new
      family, planetary liquid nearly ready to help become mother...
    tra_npc_hot_opt_a_3: Ask about berry
    tra_npc_hot_opt_b_3: Ask about belly
    tra_npc_hot_res_a_3: Their eyes widening passionately, the Gek shares a digital
      pamphlet about the nutritional properties of fireberries. The data is graphed
      to illustrate long and short term health benefits, and seems to position the
      fruit as a superior choice to synthetic alternatives.
    tra_npc_hot_res_b_3: "%NAME% smiles knowingly, but says nothing more."
    tra_npc_hot_ret_desc_3: "%NAME% eyes my pack with optimism, hoping I might have
      brought the fireberries they crave..."
    tra_npc_hot_ret_opt_a_3: Give fireberries
    tra_npc_hot_ret2_desc_3: |-
      The Gek sings aloud, a joyous scent surrounding them. They carefully stash away the berries, and transfer me the promised payment.
      I seem to have earned %NAME%'s trust, as they share an image of a natural rock pool, heated by the local star, ideal for traditional Gek spawning. They beam at me, offering the honor of naming their first grown...
    tra_npc_hot_ret2_opt_a_3: Name for wealth
    tra_npc_hot_ret2_opt_b_3: Name for generosity
    tra_npc_hot_ret2_opt_c_3: Name for cleverness
    tra_npc_hot_ret2_res_a_3: The Gek nods, their trust in me well-placed. With such
      a strong name, perhaps their spawn will grow to become a great Trade Lord. They
      are so pleased, they offer a token of thanks.
    tra_npc_hot_ret2_res_b_3: The Gek seems puzzled by my choice, but seems to honor
      it, making a note of my suggested name.
    tra_npc_hot_ret2_res_c_3: The Gek looks thoughtful, as though this was not a naming
      choice they had considered. They seem appreciative of my advice, and offer a
      token of thanks.
    tra_npc_hot_desc_4: |-
      Before I can react, the Gek pulls out a small bottle and sprays my gloves with a strong-smelling oil. My suit does not react adversely, but they seem very careful not to touch the oil themselves.
      They hold a datapad towards me. Two boxes appear on the display; the trader presses their own finger to one, and indicates I should touch the other with my oiled glove...
    dnt_tra_npc_hot_lang_4: Hello friend! I am very nearly accredited for excellent
      technology sale! Just need federation administrator identification here...
    tra_npc_hot_opt_a_4: Inspect datapad
    tra_npc_hot_opt_b_4: Touch screen
    tra_npc_hot_res_a_4: The document onscreen bears official Gek Trade Federation
      watermarks. Its exact purpose is difficult to discern - the text is miniscule,
      the language unfamiliar - but it seems to be a permit of sorts, requiring two
      Gek biosignatures...
    tra_npc_hot_ret_opt_a_4: Forge biosignature
    tra_npc_hot_ret_opt_b_4: Report crime
    tra_npc_hot_ret_res_a_4: "%NAME% gives me a cheerful wink. They are now an authorized
      technology vendor, stocking Exosuit thermal protection upgrades. They offer
      a once-in-a-lifetime price, in appreciation of such a valued friend..."
    tra_npc_hot_ret_res_b_4: Dismayed, %NAME% snatches back the datapad. Gesturing
      angrily, they refuse to speak to me.
    tra_npc_hot_ret_res_b_4alt: Dismayed, %NAME% snatches back the datapad. Looking
      fearful, they transfer me a cluster of nanites. They hope this will buy my silence.
    tra_npc_hot_ret2_opt_a_4: Buy technology
    tra_npc_hot_ret2_opt_b_4: Report crime
    tra_npc_hot_ret2_res_b_4: Dismayed, %NAME% tries to snatch the datapad out of
      sight, but it is too late. The Gek Trade Federation punishes both of us for
      our involvement in black market trade.
    tra_npc_hot_desc_5: "%NAME% is fussing over a small insulated crate at their feet.
      Beads of condensation form rapidly on the crate's sides - whatever is inside
      will not remain frozen much longer. The Gek shows me the expired remains of
      the crate's seal, tattered and useless..."
    dnt_tra_npc_hot_lang_5: Sweet frozen products in peril, friend! Temperature breach
      means all my work will be destroyed...
    tra_npc_hot_opt_a_5: Offer replacement
    tra_npc_hot_res_a_5: The Gek brightens, installing the replacement part. They
      open the crate to reveal a selection of iced confectionery, each with a signature
      aroma and flavor. They indicate a willingness to compensate me for my opinion...
    tra_npc_hot_ret_opt_a_5: Try GekNip sample
    tra_npc_hot_ret_opt_b_5: Try Anomalous sample
    tra_npc_hot_ret_opt_c_5: Try Whispering Egg sample
    tra_npc_hot_ret_res_a_5: |-
      The chilled confectionary is a delight to the senses, sweet and creamy. I feel deeply relaxed, and yet also somehow hungrier than before. It is disappointing when it is all gone.
      %NAME% giggles, apparently entertained. They make a note of my preference and response, and provide payment for my feedback.
    tra_npc_hot_ret_res_b_5: |-
      The sweet, creamy flavor of the confectionary is soon overwhelmed by an escalating attack on my other senses. My ears fill with static and my vision fills with crimson. It grows louder and brighter, becoming unbearable...
      For one bittersweet moment, I feel like I have come home. Then, suddenly, it is all over. I am here with %NAME%, holding ordinary iced nutrients.
      I return the strange product to the Gek, not wishing to repeat the experience. They seem slightly stunned. They provide payment for my feedback.
    tra_npc_hot_ret_res_c_5: |-
      The chilled confectionary initially tastes sweet and creamy, and delightfully cooling. It is only after a few moments that a bitter aftertaste sets in, prickling poisonously at my throat.
      I have a sudden craving for meat. %NAME% is looking quite delicious...
      The Gek clears their throat. They hastily pay for my feedback, making a note to themselves.
    tra_npc_cold_desc_1: There is a set of damp footprints around this Gek, their
      boots still lightly dusted in snow. They seem disoriented, looking hazily around
      themselves as though searching for something they've lost.
    dnt_tra_npc_cold_lang_1: Hello? Friend? Here? No no no... friend lost in snow...
      everything white, sky falling...
    tra_npc_cold_opt_a_1: Offer help
    tra_npc_cold_opt_b_1: Leave
    tra_npc_cold_res_a_1: |-
      The Gek turns slowly to look me in the eyes. They shakily enter some coordinates into my Exosuit, presumably the last location of whatever it is they've misplaced out in the cold.
      They show me an emblem decorating their suit, tapping it twice for emphasis.
    tra_npc_cold_res_b_1: The shivering trader continues to look around themselves,
      barely seeming to notice me.
    tra_npc_cold_wait_1: The shivering trader continues to look around themselves,
      barely seeming to notice me.
    tra_npc_cold_comp_1: 'This Gek bears a familiar emblem - I immediately recognize
      it from the suit of the Gek who directed me to this region. '
    tra_npc_cold_desc_2: |-
      This Gek has an enterprising look in their eyes, as though on the verge of some groundbreaking business venture. They are shivering noticeably, but it's impossible to tell whether cold or excitement is responsible.
      Hailing me, %NAME% shows me a set of schematics for a potential local farm. They indicate the tundra outside. I gather that they are <STELLAR>asking for my assistance<>...
    dnt_tra_npc_cold_lang_2: Opportunity to establish profitable new farm... but too
      cold outside, no place for trader! Help friend, advance share of profits? Good
      deal for you!
    tra_npc_cold_opt_a_2: Offer botanical assistance
    tra_npc_cold_opt_b_2: Leave
    tra_npc_cold_res_a_2: Still shivering, %NAME% bounces slightly, evidently pleased
      to do business with me. They rub their hands together over and over.
    tra_npc_cold_res_b_2: "%NAME% is dismayed to see me walk away from their offer.
      They continue to shiver, looking mournfully at both their schematics and the
      hostile weather outside."
    tra_npc_cold_farm_ret: "%NAME% is gleefully reviewing their farm's projected revenue
      when I return. Beneath the potential yield and export value, I catch sight of
      a staggering profit margin. The trader's eyes drift to my backpack, hoping I
      have retrieved the requested botanical samples..."
    tra_npc_cold_farm_ret_opt_a: Give samples
    tra_npc_cold_farm_ret_res_a: |-
      The Gek places a fistful of the Frost Crystals into a cylindrical device. A ring of light glides over the samples, cleanly disintegrating the chaff and foliage, then depositing the bare seeds into %NAME%'s open palm.
      They hand the seeds to me for the final step, beaming expectantly.
    tra_npc_cold_farm_ret_opt_b: Demand extra payment
    tra_npc_cold_farm_ret_res_b: |-
      %NAME% huffs with annoyance and conceals the datapad. Nonetheless, they grudgingly transfer a bonus payment. They make a note to themselves, then reassume their affable facade, as though it had never slipped.
      The Gek places a fistful of the Frost Crystals into a small glass cylinder. A ring of light glides over the samples, cleanly disintegrating the chaff and foliage, then depositing the bare seeds into %NAME%'s open palm.
      They hand the seeds to me for the final step, beaming expectantly.
    tra_npc_cold_desc_3: |-
      The Gek is stirring a steaming liquid in a self-heating bowl. They sniff it, then shake their head forlornly.
      Gesturing at my Exosuit storage, they perk up. They appear to be requesting a rather unusual ingredient...
    dnt_tra_npc_cold_lang_3: Friend is cold, yes? Blood is frozen? Together we make
      special Gek tradition hot fluid, very healing!
    tra_npc_cold_opt_a_3: Provide ingredient
    tra_npc_cold_opt_b_3: Leave
    tra_npc_cold_res_a_3: The Gek drops the soft pellets into the liquid, clicking
      their beak in time with each splash. They stir the bowl's contents, then decant
      the fluid into two smaller vessels - offering one to me, and raising the other
      to their own beak.
    tra_npc_cold_ret_opt_a_3: Drink the pungent fluid
    tra_npc_cold_ret_opt_b_3: Refuse
    tra_npc_cold_ret_res_a_3: |-
      I take a tentative mouthful of the gritty liquid. A comforting warmth spreads gently throughout my limbs... followed by a hot wave of nausea.
      Not seeming to notice my discomfort, the trader clinks their bowl against mine, happy to have shared their tradition.
    tra_npc_cold_ret_res_b_3: The Gek seems hurt by my refusal. They snatch my cup
      away and gulp messily from their own, some of the thick liquid slopping down
      their front. The smell is extraordinary.
    tra_npc_cold_desc_4: 'The Gek shows me a digital catalogue of frozen products
      they have for sale, the prices unusually reasonable. As the reel concludes,
      a message displays, translated into language I can understand: ''Red Hood Renewable
      Refrigeration: Savings for us are savings for friends!'''
    tra_npc_cold_ret_desc_4: |-
      The merchant is thrilled to pass their savings onto me. A wonderful smell delights my senses, their happiness becoming mine. Purchasing from this Gek feels blissful...
      <PROP>None<>Suddenly, %NAME% pauses. They giggle. They shrug. It seems I have completely exhausted their stocks.
    dnt_tra_npc_cold_lang_4: Such luck for you, uncommon opportunity for excellent
      frozen products! Savings for us are savings for friends!
    tra_npc_cold_opt_a_4: Buy food products
    tra_npc_cold_opt_b_4: Buy plant products
    tra_npc_cold_opt_d_4: Really leave
    tra_npc_cold_res_a_4: The merchant is thrilled to pass their savings onto me.
      A wonderful smell delights my senses, their happiness becoming mine. Purchasing
      from this Gek feels blissful...
    tra_npc_cold_res_c_4: The Gek smiles and shakes their head. They replay the product
      reel, emphasizing the uniqueness of this purchasing opportunity...
    tra_npc_cold_desc_5: Nothing about this Gek's appearance is unusual, and yet some
      aspect of their presence seems incomplete. It is only when I notice a gland
      flaring weakly on their neck that I realize they are entirely odorless.
    dnt_tra_npc_cold_lang_5: Cold planet denied reach of smells! Pheromones blocked!
    tra_npc_cold_opt_a_5: Inhale deeply
    tra_npc_cold_res_a_5: "%NAME%'s eyes widen with embarrassment. Scrambling to regain
      their dignity, they begin to secrete an oily substance, and a sweet, subtle
      fragrance begins to reach me - but is quickly muted by the cold."
    tra_npc_cold_ret_opt_a_5: Offer sustenance
    tra_npc_cold_ret_opt_b_5: Offer warmth
    tra_npc_cold_ret_res_a_5: The Gek gobbles down the food gratefully. The oily substance
      flows faster, their scales immediately becoming glossy and plump, their enhanced
      pheromones penetrating the cold air.
    tra_npc_cold_ret_res_b_5: The Gek gratefully refuels a small heating device, hugging
      it close to them. Their eyes drift closed for a moment as their core temperature
      rises.
    tra_npc_cold_ret2_desc_5: Renewed and beaming, the Gek offers me a choice of scents
      for demonstration...
    tra_npc_cold_ret2_opt_a_5: Choose the smell of success
    tra_npc_cold_ret2_opt_b_5: Choose the smell of dreams
    tra_npc_cold_ret2_res_a_5: I temporarily lose myself in the smell of profit, ambition,
      intergalactic power. When I come to, the Gek is smiling at me. I feel a little
      wealthier.
    tra_npc_cold_ret2_res_b_5: I temporarily lose myself in the smell of distant realities,
      the possibilities of infinite worlds. When I come to, the Gek is smiling at
      me. I feel a little wiser.
    tra_npc_lush_desc_2: |-
      This Gek's fragrance struck me before I noticed them. Their very presence is an olfactory delight of spring and sunshine, and they appear to know it, smugly waving me over.
      %NAME% produces a gem-like Star Bramble blossom, deeply inhaling the air around it. They offer it to me, but I detect no scent beyond the Gek's own pheromones.
      Waving the blossom in my face, the sharp-eyed lifeform indicates the bountiful fields outside. I gather that they are <STELLAR>asking for my assistance<>...
    dnt_tra_npc_lush_lang_2: This world is a pleasure of smells, friend, you agree?
      I am studying the fragrance of local Star Bramble blossoms. Gives me much influence,
      happy customers! But nature offers insufficient growth!
    tra_npc_lush_opt_a_2: Offer botanical assistance
    tra_npc_lush_opt_b_2: Leave
    tra_npc_lush_res_a_2: Unable to contain their excitement, the Gek's pheromones
      explode in a dizzying spectrum of smells.
    tra_npc_lush_res_b_2: The Gek seems disappointed, and makes a private note to
      themselves.
    tra_npc_lush_farm_ret: |-
      %NAME% greets me with such exuberant charm that I almost blush. Despite their alien appearance, it is impossible not to feel enamored with this brilliant, kind-hearted, generous, resourceful, strong, clever, talented, hard-working, sensitive, beautiful--
      I catch the thought spiral. The Gek's pheromones must be exceptionally powerful to cause this. They smile coyly.
    tra_npc_lush_farm_ret_opt_a: Purchase pheromones
    tra_npc_lush_farm_ret_res_a: "%NAME% seems willing to sell a little of their magic.
      They install the pheromone dispenser directly into my Exosuit. It will remain
      potent for at least a few years, they assure me."
    tra_npc_lush_farm_ret_opt_b: Give samples
    tra_npc_lush_farm_ret_res_b: |-
      %NAME%'s delight is infectious. It feels glorious just being near them.
      With deft, beguiling movements, they pluck the seeds from the blossoms, and place them in my hand. Anywhere in the soil outside will soon nourish these into healthy Star Brambles.
    tra_npc_lush_desc_3: This Gek is all smiles and hospitable pheromones. They indicate
      that they are set up to receive tourists such as myself, and have an assortment
      of useful items in stock, depending on how much I have to spend...
    dnt_tra_npc_lush_lang_3: Benevolent temperature planet brings many visit from
      friends! Five traveller today! SalesGek stockpile going fast, buy now!
    tra_npc_lush_opt_a_3: Very few units
    tra_npc_lush_opt_b_3: A modest sum
    tra_npc_lush_opt_c_3: Fabulous riches
    tra_npc_lush_res_a_3: "%NAME% murmurs an acknowledgement, though can't quite hide
      their disappointment. For very few units, they could offer any of the following..."
    tra_npc_lush_reta_opt_a_3: Some antique iron
    tra_npc_lush_reta_opt_b_3: Some friendly slime
    tra_npc_lush_reta_opt_c_3: Some dead tree
    tra_npc_lush_res_b_3: "%NAME% looks pleased. For a modest sum, they could offer

    tra_npc_lush_retb_opt_b_3: Hazard protection fuel
    tra_npc_lush_retb_opt_c_3: Starship launch fuel
    tra_npc_lush_res_c_3: "%NAME% giggles reflexively, releasing a joyous burst of
      scent. I am their favorite sort of customer. For a reasonable sum, they could
      offer any of the following..."
    tra_npc_lush_retc_opt_a_3: Exosuit technology
    tra_npc_lush_retc_opt_b_3: Starship technology
    tra_npc_lush_retc_opt_c_3: Multi-Tool technology
    tra_npc_lush_ret_opt_d_3: Something else...
    tra_npc_lush_res_all_3: The Gek produces my chosen product with a flourish and
      a little bow.
    tra_npc_dust_desc_2: |-
      This Gek has a desperate look in their eyes. They hastily conceal something from my view, but then a moment later seem to reconsider, sadly revealing what appears to be a withered plant, quite dead.
      They indicate the arid earth outside, the shriveled alien flora flopping pathetically in their hand. I gather that they are <STELLAR>asking for my assistance<>...
    dnt_tra_npc_dust_lang_2: Traveller friend! So happy to have help! I have big trouble!
      Maybe I took too many plants from the local dirt. Now the dirt is ruined! Need
      love, new plants!
    tra_npc_dust_opt_a_2: Offer botanical assistance
    tra_npc_dust_opt_b_2: Leave
    tra_npc_dust_res_a_2: The Gek looks so relieved that for a moment, I think they
      are about to embrace me. I leave quickly.
    tra_npc_dust_res_b_2: An indescribable percussive sound issues from the Gek's
      beak. I get the impression that if the lifeform had lips, it would be pouting.
    tra_npc_dust_farm_ret: "%NAME% is still nursing the wilted cactus, but tosses
      it aside the moment they see me. They eye the fresh Cactus Flesh greedily."
    tra_npc_dust_farm_ret_opt_a: Give samples
    tra_npc_dust_farm_ret_res_a: |-
      The Gek thanks me. They run the cactus through a device that drains the flesh and squeezes the seeds loose. The motions come naturally, as though they've done this hundreds of times, but I notice their hands shaking.
      They hand over the seeds for planting, but look at me quizzically. Their confidence is rattled. What if these crops, too, wither and die?
    tra_npc_dust_farm_ret2_opt_a: Suggest something stronger
    tra_npc_dust_farm_ret2_opt_a1: Suggest coprite
    tra_npc_dust_farm_ret2_opt_a2: Suggest faecium
    tra_npc_dust_farm_ret2_opt_b: Suggest nitrogen salt
    tra_npc_dust_farm_ret2_opt_c: Suggest reducing harvest
    tra_npc_dust_farm_ret2_res_a: "%NAME% makes a disgusted face, but seems to accept
      the advice, assuring me they will follow through - once I have got their farm
      started."
    tra_npc_dust_farm_ret2_res_b: "%NAME%'s eyes open wide. Nitrogen salt is expensive.
      However, they seem to accept the advice, assuring me they will follow through
      - once I have got their farm started."
    tra_npc_dust_farm_ret2_res_c: "%NAME% seems depressed by the idea of sacrificing
      some of their valuable crops to nature. However, they seem to accept the advice,
      assuring me they will follow through - once I have got their farm started."
    tra_npc_dust_desc_3: This Gek seems lost in thought, their eyes unfocused and
      scent glands inactive. Distractedly, they greet me, but lack the polished facade
      customary of their species. They indicate they have nothing to trade.
    dnt_tra_npc_dust_lang_3: Sweet memories... sorry, friend, please leave me. I do
      not feel like trading today.
    tra_npc_dust_opt_a_3: Ask about trade
    tra_npc_dust_opt_b_3: Ask about pheromones
    tra_npc_dust_opt_c_3: Ask about friends
    tra_npc_dust_res_a_3: "%NAME% shakes their head, dismissing me. They indicate
      that they wish to be left alone."
    tra_npc_dust_res_b_3: "%NAME% shakes their head, dismissing me. They indicate
      that they wish to be left alone."
    tra_npc_dust_res_c_3: |-
      The small lifeform perks up, sharing an image of two Gek children. One is clearly %NAME% themselves. The other, grubby-faced, clutches a muddy trowel. They stand hand in hand, the very best of friends.
      The Gek looks at me inquisitively, pointing towards their childhood friend, searching my face for any recognition.
    tra_npc_dust_ret_opt_a_3: Say you recognize the Gek
    tra_npc_dust_ret_opt_b_3: Say you don't
    tra_npc_dust_ret_res_a_3: |-
      In the strangest of coincidences, the other Gek in the image is unquestionably familiar: I recognize the farmer I hired to attend my base. This must be their home planet.
      %NAME% is beside themselves with joy as I share the coordinates for my base. They thank me over and over, babbling in their own language, and finishing up with a gift.
    tra_npc_dust_ret_res_b_3: I shake my head apologetically. I cannot place this
      specific Gek, not with any certainty. %NAME%, nodding sadly, seems to have expected
      this response.
    tra_npc_tox_desc_2: |-
      The Gek flinches as I approach, and hurriedly stows the datapad they were examining. I catch only a fleeting glimpse of a healthy-looking financial report, alongside what looks like plans for a nutrient distribution and irrigation system.
      They indicate the toxic landscape outside, pointing out some of the more striking fungal clusters. I gather that they are <STELLAR>asking for my assistance<>...
    dnt_tra_npc_tox_lang_2: My friend has much admired farm, always they succeeds!
      Help distribute spores here, create rival business?
    tra_npc_tox_opt_a_2: Offer botanical assistance
    tra_npc_tox_opt_b_2: Leave
    tra_npc_tox_res_a_2: The Gek seems taken aback by my offer of help, as though
      they had somehow expected less from me. They nod tentatively, again pointing
      out the fungal clusters.
    tra_npc_tox_res_b_2: The Gek looks at me blankly, their expression unreadable.
    tra_npc_tox_farm_ret: "%NAME% jumps in surprise. It seems they hadn't expected
      to see me again."
    tra_npc_tox_farm_ret_opt_a: Give samples
    tra_npc_tox_farm_ret_res_a: The Gek takes the fungus, but their response is muted.
      They sniff at its gills suspiciously. They seem to be questioning its origins,
      perhaps thinking me some sort of threat, or spy.
    tra_npc_tox_farm_ret2_opt_a: Give units
    tra_npc_tox_farm_ret2_opt_b: Threaten them
    tra_npc_tox_farm_ret2_opt_c: Prove identity
    tra_npc_tox_farm_ret2_res_a: |-
      The trader shivers with involuntary pleasure as they receive the units. They still seem suspicious, but the monetary gift has soothed them somewhat.
      Taking the mold in one hand, they process it in a small device. The contraption steams up, and the spores inflate into what look like miniature fungal trees. The bizarre spectacle is over in moments.
    tra_npc_tox_farm_ret2_res_b: "%NAME%, already on edge, reacts poorly to being
      threatened. They shout at me furiously to get out of their sight."
    tra_npc_tox_farm_ret2_res_c: |-
      I produce my Exosuit's logs of my past dealings with other Geks. %NAME%, persuaded of my integrity, apologizes profusely. They transfer me units as a gesture of goodwill.
      Taking the mold in one hand, they process it in a small device. The contraption steams up, and the spores inflate into what look like miniature fungal trees. The bizarre spectacle is over in moments.
    tra_npc_tox_desc_3: A musty odor surrounds this Gek, their scales glistening with
      anxious sweat. They seem glad of my company, but not entirely present in it,
      their eyes darting repeatedly towards a landing pad outside this facility.
    dnt_tra_npc_tox_lang_3: Grand Festival events imminent! Collection is late, late,
      late! Trade Lords will not be happy!
    tra_npc_tox_opt_a_3: Ask about landing pad
    tra_npc_tox_opt_b_3: Ask about container
    tra_npc_tox_res_a_3: The Gek gazes anxiously towards the landing pads, as though
      hoping to see a specific ship. They indicate the container they clutch, and
      gesture towards a date printed on its side.
    tra_npc_tox_res_b_3: |-
      Surreptitiously, as though not authorized to do so, %NAME% cracks open the container they clutch. Inside, I glimpse a pale fungus, coated in fur. It looks freshly picked, and smells dizzying, almost like starship fuel.
      The Gek licks their beak, then quickly re-seals the container. They gesture towards a date printed on its side, then again look towards the facility's landing pads.
    tra_npc_tox_ret_3: Fresh perspiration leaks from their face. Whoever was scheduled
      to collect this product from %NAME% is running very late.
    tra_npc_tox_ret_opt_a_3: Offer to deliver product
    tra_npc_tox_ret_opt_b_3: Request official help
    tra_npc_tox_ret_res_a_3: "%NAME%'s eyes widen as I reach for the container, shaking
      their head no. They acknowledge the sincerity of my offer, but cannot let this
      out of their sight."
    tra_npc_tox_ret_res_b_3: |-
      Reaching out to the local authorities, I prompt %NAME% to explain their dilemma. There is a muffled <AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>sound in the transmission, then a new voice comes on the line.
      A Gek Trade Lord - speaking in language I can understand - personally thanks me. I am to be compensated for my assistance, and a different courier will be along shortly to deliver the container to the Grand Festival.
    tra_npc_rad_desc_2: |-
      This Gek is examining an array of hydro-balanced specimen capsules, each crafted from a slightly different material, and containing a single blossom, oddly radiant.
      The small lifeform beams at me, apparently proud to show off their botanical collection. They indicate the irradiated landscape outside. I gather that they are <STELLAR>asking for my assistance<>...
    dnt_tra_npc_rad_lang_2: I am loving life! Loving plants here, such excellence!
      Nothing to do with profits.
    tra_npc_rad_opt_a_2: Offer botanical assistance
    tra_npc_rad_opt_b_2: Leave
    tra_npc_rad_res_a_2: The Gek clicks their beak in jittery excitement, pleased
      to have found a kindred soul with an interest in plants.
    tra_npc_rad_res_b_2: The Gek raises one of the blossom capsules, as if to prove
      how beautiful it is. They look sad as I leave.
    tra_npc_rad_farm_ret_lang: No need for queries. The technology will be obedient.
    tra_npc_rad_farm_ret: "%NAME% terminates a call. They greet me sweetly, hoping
      I have brought the promised Gamma Weed cuttings."
    tra_npc_rad_farm_ret_opt_a: Give samples
    tra_npc_rad_farm_ret_res_a: "%NAME% inserts the glowing weed into a handheld device,
      which begins to vibrate. Puffs of luminous pollen drift around the chamber.
      The Gek then hands me the extracted seeds, ready for planting."
    tra_npc_rad_farm_ret_opt_b: Ask about call
    tra_npc_rad_farm_ret_res_b: A look of concentration passes over the Gek's face,
      and I am hit with a cloying smell. It is distractingly unidentifiable - somewhere
      between burnt sugar and decomposition. I find I can't remember what I just asked.
    tra_npc_rad_desc_3: |-
      Something about this Gek seems pioneering, bold. A light dusting of soil coats the ends of their sleeves, as though they've been rummaging in the earth outside.
      They show me a chunk of irradiated mineral they have collected - not uranium, but a glowing crimson substance that I struggle to look at directly. They have fashioned some of the strange material into an experimental suit upgrade, apparently ready to sell...
    dnt_tra_npc_rad_lang_3: Look at this geological find! Element shiny like stars,
      makes good suit technology for you, friend!
    tra_npc_rad_opt_a_3: Trade units for upgrade
    tra_npc_rad_opt_b_3: Trade gift for upgrade
    tra_npc_rad_res_a_3: |-
      As I reach out to take the technology, I am suddenly overpowered by nausea. For a moment, everything hurts - every joint screams, my soft tissue on fire, the pressure behind my eyes unbearable...
      The moment passes. The Gek looks at me, slightly puzzled, but is pleased to have made a sale.
    tra_npc_shop_desc_1: This Gek is gripping a datapad, making notes in what appears
      to be a personalized database of product IDs and associated prices. Their fingers
      fly across the screen with a zealous, almost greedy enthusiasm.
    dnt_tra_npc_shop_lang_1: So much to buy! Best trade on planet! Economy here is
      fascinating, friend! I research, find best trade routes.
    tra_npc_shop_opt_a_1: Examine data
    tra_npc_shop_opt_b_1: Deeply examine data
    tra_npc_shop_opt_c_1: Request commodity evaluation
    tra_npc_shop_res_a_1: The Gek seems happy to share their research. They eagerly
      talk me through some of their favorite trade routes, and offer directions to
      a nearby outpost.
    tra_npc_shop_res_b_1: The Gek seems thrilled to share their research with a genuine
      friend. They eagerly talk me through some of their favorite trade routes, and
      offer directions to a nearby outpost, gifting me Units as a gesture of friendship.
    tra_npc_shop_res_c_1: The Gek rotates the curio in their hands, squeaking with
      approval as they assess its quality. They offer me a good price, and make note
      of the system where they can turn a profit on it.
    tra_npc_shop_desc_2: |-
      This Gek has been observing me closely from the moment I stepped into this small trade outlet. They look completely at home, as though most of their time is spent here.
      They share two images of Multi-Tools: the left one elaborate and extensively modified, accompanied by a large Unit sum; the right a simpler but far less expensive model. They look at me expectantly, awaiting a choice.
    dnt_tra_npc_shop_lang_2: Hello friend! Units to spend? Which product would friend
      choose?
    tra_npc_shop_opt_a_2: Choose left image
    tra_npc_shop_opt_b_2: Choose right image
    tra_npc_shop_opt_c_2: Choose both
    tra_npc_shop_res_a_2: A delighted shriek erupts from the Gek, causing my ears
      to ring. A sunny aroma fills the small building, and the Gek transfers me a
      gift of Units. I itch to spend them immediately.
    tra_npc_shop_res_b_2: They seem unsurprised by my choice, and exchange both a
      meaningful look and an eye-stinging scent with the Gek behind the counter.
    tra_npc_shop_res_c_2: The Gek pauses, thrown by my choice. Evidently, they had
      not considered the possibility of this outcome. Eventually their beak opens
      into a smile, and offer me Units to encourage my urge to spend.
    tra_npc_shop_desc_3: The Gek is lazily browsing the trade terminal catalogue,
      not appearing to be searching for anything in particular. They make a note of
      a few items that apparently catch their interest, uttering a soft exclamation
      to themselves.
    dnt_tra_npc_shop_lang_3: Best bargains on best items for best Gek friends! Merchant
      and I best friends since spawn.
    tra_npc_shop_opt_a_3: Join in browsing
    tra_npc_shop_opt_b_3: Point to highlighted item
    tra_npc_shop_opt_c_3: Point to random item
    tra_npc_shop_res_a_3: The Gek chuckles to themselves as I accompany their browsing
      the items available for trade. I somehow get the feeling that I am the subject
      of their private joke. They pat me gently and give me Units, as though in sympathy.
    tra_npc_shop_res_b_3: The Gek suddenly takes notice, looking me up and down. After
      a moment of assessment, they shake their head, indicating a different item instead.
      They are so pleased by the opportunity to share their knowledge that they purchase
      and gift me the item.
    tra_npc_shop_res_c_3: The Gek looks at me, looks at the item I have indicated,
      looks at me again - and then dissolves into helpless giggling. The merchant
      behind the counter shakes their head in a way that suggests they have seen this
      scenario before.
    tra_npc_shop_desc_4: This Gek is entering copious notes into a datapad, looking
      around furtively. They seem to be assessing the quality of this trade facility,
      but when they notice me observing them, they straighten themselves awkwardly
      and shield the device's screen from view.
    dnt_tra_npc_shop_lang_4: Not for your eyes! I am just customer, not from rival
      trade station, nothing illegal!
    tra_npc_shop_opt_a_4: Peek at notes
    tra_npc_shop_opt_b_4: Point out a facility detail
    tra_npc_shop_opt_c_4: Alert merchant
    tra_npc_shop_res_a_4: The Gek seems irritated, snatching their datapad away from
      my reach. They point at themselves and then at me, shaking their head and babbling
      until I leave.
    tra_npc_shop_res_b_4: I subtly draw %NAME%'s attention to a minor manufacturing
      fault in the facility's construction. They seem oddly comforted by the detail,
      adding it to their notes. They coyly slip me a gift in thanks.
    tra_npc_shop_res_c_4: I clear my throat loudly, drawing the nearby merchant's
      attention to %NAME%'s surreptitious note-taking. A gentle alarm sounds, and
      I am immediately rewarded by the Gek Trade Federation for aiding the fight against
      corporate espionage.
    tra_npc_outpost_desc_1: |-
      The Gek, overwhelmed by excitement, begins to hyperventilate as I approach. They query something on their datapad, then look up at me.
      Proudly, they extend a hand to shake mine, confident they have identified the socially appropriate greeting for my species.
    dnt_tra_npc_outpost_lang_1: A new friend! A traveller friend! I am here to make
      new friends. I must choose the correct hello...
    tra_npc_outpost_opt_a_1: Shake their hand
    tra_npc_outpost_opt_b_1: Embrace them
    tra_npc_outpost_opt_c_1: Punch them
    tra_npc_outpost_res_a_1: A coo of delight escapes %NAME% as we shake hands. Their
      grip is surprisingly well calibrated, neither too firm nor too flimsy. It is
      a well-researched handshake, if unpracticed.
    tra_npc_outpost_res_b_1: "%NAME% gasps, recognizing this alternative form of greeting.
      There is an awkward clink of beak upon glass as they attempt to kiss my visor."
    tra_npc_outpost_res_c_1: "%NAME% begins to cry, not understanding what error they
      made to provoke such an aggressive response. They no longer seem to want to
      be friends."
    tra_npc_outpost_ret_1: The Gek gestures around the outpost, indicating all the
      friends they have acquired here. They then gesture towards me, smiling shyly.
      I am now counted among %NAME%'s many friends, and they would like to know the
      size of my own friendship circle.
    tra_npc_outpost_ret_opt_a_1: A modest circle
    tra_npc_outpost_ret_opt_b_1: A wide circle
    tra_npc_outpost_ret_opt_c_1: An enviable circle
    tra_npc_outpost_ret_res_a_1: The Gek's expression flickers, something else briefly
      replacing their excitement. Out of their depth, they regress to the social niceties
      most familiar to them, and gift me units to assist with my future friendships.
    tra_npc_outpost_ret_res_b_1: The Gek looks awed to be in the company of such a
      prominent diplomat. %NAME% slips something into my hand, hoping I will remember
      them.
    tra_npc_outpost_ret_res_c_1: |-
      %NAME% is hyperventilating again.
      Instinctively, they shower me with units, hoping to impress.
    tra_npc_obs_desc_1: This Gek seems startled, their breathing rapid and shallow.
      Apparently, they were not expecting company.
    dnt_tra_npc_obs_lang_1: Friend surprised me! This is legal business network! But
      technology does need help...
    tra_npc_obs_desc_1a: "%NAME%'s sharp eyes dart over my pack, considering its possible
      contents. They cautiously point towards the facility's terminal, perhaps requesting
      help..."
    tra_npc_obs_opt_a_1: Offer assistance
    tra_npc_obs_res_a_1: The Gek nods warily, their guard still up.
    tra_npc_obs_res_b_1: The Gek says nothing, keeping their thoughts to themselves.
    tra_npc_obs_wait_1: The Gek gives a sceptical click of their beak. The facility
      terminal remains non-functional, at least for whatever %NAME%'s purposes are.
    tra_term_obs_desc_1: |-
      The facility dish is sweeping for some ancient signal, the terminal tarnished with age and disuse. However, the dust is smeared in places, where modern components have been wired into the original equipment.
      Whatever this terminal was repurposed for, it is currently malfunctioning. The modern tech has been inexpertly installed, and the central wiring loom seems to have short circuited.
    tra_term_obs_opt_a_1: Replace loom
    tra_term_obs_chain_desc_1: |-
      The display immediately brightens, rendering a celestial map of several nearby systems. Dozens of starship beacons, red and green, blink erratically around the map.
      Periodically, the green beacons swarm together, encircling a target. The surrounded beacon fades to nothing, apparently destroyed. At the bottom of the screen, a <IMG>UNITS<> value increases dramatically.
    tra_term_obs_chain_opt_a_1: Download report
    tra_term_obs_chain_opt_b_1: Extract profits

      PROFIT: <IMG>UNITS<>392M <IMG>SLASH<> 'CUSTOMERS': 2241 <IMG>SLASH<> EMPLOYEE SHIPS: 482
    tra_term_obs_chain_res_a_1: The final line of the report stands out from the rest
      of the data, explicitly revealing the nature of this Galactic 'Friend' Network...
    tra_term_obs_chain2_res_lang_a_: 'EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH: DREAD PIRATE OGAARKIV'
    tra_term_obs_chain2_res_a_1: I download the data to my Exosuit logs. I could consider
      confronting the Gek with these findings.
    tra_term_obs_chain_res_b_1: |-
      I select the option to 'extract profits' from the terminal. My account immediately begins to flood with units, thousands upon thousands.
      The nearby Gek suddenly notices what I am doing. They shut the process down, screaming at me to get out.
    tra_npc_obs_ret_desc_1: The Gek looks pleased to see their network connection
      restored, though there is still a skittishness about them. They offer me a reasonable
      sum of units for the supplies and labour I have provided.
    tra_npc_obs_ret_opt_a_1: Accept payment
    tra_npc_obs_ret_opt_b_1: Threaten with data
    tra_npc_obs_ret_res_a_1: "%NAME% seems to relax at last. They transfer the promised
      payment with a sly smile."
    tra_npc_obs_ret_res_b_1: "%NAME% trembles with rage or fear - or both. They offer
      an increased sum, a substantial bribe for my silence."
    tra_npc_obs_ret2_opt_a_1: Accept bribe
    tra_npc_obs_ret2_opt_b_1: Report piracy
    tra_npc_obs_ret2_res_a_1: The Gek transfers the bribe with a forced smile, then
      pointedly motions for me to leave.
    tra_npc_obs_ret2_res_b_1: I report the illegal pirate network to the Gek Trade
      Federation. %NAME% wails with despair, cursing themselves for involving me.
      The authorities, however, are thrilled, and transfer a generous reward.
    tra_npc_freighter_desc_1: This Gek seems relatively new to freighter life. From
      time to time their eyes drift towards the windows, mesmerised by the infinite
      expanse of stars and the distant worlds orbiting them.
    tra_npc_freighter_desc_2: The Gek stares at me with open fascination. Something
      about their wide-eyed curiosity seems naive, as though they've lived a sheltered
      existence. Perhaps they have never stepped outside this very freighter.
    tra_npc_freighter_desc_3: The gloves of this Gek's Exosuit bear traces of food,
      and the fingers are slightly puckered, suggesting a long history of damage and
      repair.
    tra_npc_freighter_desc_4: This Gek seems content enough to serve on this freighter,
      but I notice them checking their account balance with a frequency bordering
      on obsessive. Perhaps they see a different life in their future.
    tra_npc_freighter_desc_5: The lifeform stands to attention as I near them, stashing
      away some products they've readied for trade. Freighter life must be a lucrative
      opportunity for enterprising Geks.

    exp_reply_word_get8: "%NAME% pauses, briefly motionless as they assess something.
      Finally, they seem to soften, presenting me with a list of language symbols."
    exp_reply_word_get9: The lifeform's visor warps and flickers, some inter-Korvax
      consultation taking place. A moment later, %NAME% is restored. They present
      a list of language symbols.
    exp_reply_word_get10: "%NAME% buzzes their acknowledgement. They offer a list
      of language symbols - a choice of subjects to learn."
    exp_reply_word_get11: "%NAME% asks something incomprehensible. I stare, blank.
      Finally they present a selection of simple glyphs - concepts of word I might

      input. I recall some of the Korvax words I have learned..."
    exp_reply_word_say2: "%NAME% faces me, expressionless. I can only assume they
      are listening. I consider which Korvax word to say..."
    exp_reply_word_say3: "%NAME% activates their speech parser, waiting to hear what
      I have to say. Their shell tilts towards me with genuine fascination..."
    exp_reply_word_say4: I recall some of the Korvax words I have learned, in the
      hope of impressing %NAME%.
    exp_reply_word_say5: I clear my throat, warming up my vocal cords. Several Korvax
      words come to mind...
    exp_reply_word_say6: I inhale, thinking through some of the Korvax words I am
      confident of pronouncing...
    exp_reply_word_say7: "%NAME% appears to be preparing to take notes. I rack my
      brain for my most impressive Korvax vocabulary..."
    exp_reply_word_say8: I feel more than one entity observing me through %NAME%'s
      shell. I hurry to think of an appropriate word to say...
    exp_reply_word_say9: "%NAME%'s attention is wholly, intimidatingly, focused on
      me. I recall several Korvax words I might say to them..."
    exp_reply_word_say10: "%NAME% is silent, listening attentively. I try to think
      of an appropriate word to say..."
    exp_reply_word_say_none: "%NAME% tilts their head expectantly, but my mind goes
      blank. I should learn some more Korvax words before attempting to communicate
      in their native language."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_dir_neg_1: "%NAME% shakes their head. Whatever they believe
      I am requesting, they are not willing to provide it."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_dir_neg_2: "%NAME% is unable to parse my request. They appear
      disappointed."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_dir_neg_3: "%NAME%'s visor flashes, but our exchange ends
      there. They are unable, or unwilling, to provide directions."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_dir_neu_1: "%NAME% nods, and gestures out towards the stars."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_dir_pos_1: "%NAME% seizes my arm, seeming to believe I am
      lost. They offer directions to a nearby point of interest."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_help_neg_1: "%NAME% shakes their head sadly. They sense I
      am in need of help that they cannot provide."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_help_neu_1: "%NAME% buzzes, concerned by my choice of word."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_help_pos_1: "%NAME% interprets my language as a request for
      help. Almost reflexively, as though by some involuntary instinct, the Korvax
      recharges my exosuit."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_lore_neg_1: "%NAME% flashes their visor lights, but says
      nothing. They seem to doubt my understanding of the word I have spoken."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_lore_neu_1: "%NAME% tilts their head, intrigued by my choice
      of word."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_lore_pos_1: "%NAME% hums gently. They seem pleased by my
      knowledge of Korvax lore."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_tech_neg_1: "%NAME% recoils, apparently finding something
      crude about my word choice."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_tech_neu_1: "%NAME% seems pleasantly surprised by my choice
      of word."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_tech_pos_1: "%NAME% seems inspired by my choice of word.
      They chatter back excitedly, the sentences too long and complicated for me to
      follow."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_tech_pos_2: "%NAME% seems inspired by my choice of word.
      They glance over my exosuit, then offer me an upgrade to assist my journey."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_thrt_neg_1: "%NAME% seems fearful, unsettled by the language
      I have chosen. They respond aggressively, jolting my suit with a light electric
      shock."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_thrt_neg_2: "%NAME% regards me coldly. I sense the judgement
      of many Korvax entities staring out through their visor."
    exp_npc_res_word_say_thrt_neu_1: "%NAME% stares at me unflinchingly, their synthetic
      face unreadable."

      and gives me a gift to assist my journey."
    exp_closure_vpositive_1: "%NAME%'s carapace whirs audibly as I approach them -
      a physical manifestation of Korvax emotion. They are infinitely pleased to see
      me."
    exp_closure_vpositive_2: "%NAME%, in a rare show of Korvax humility, inclines
      their head in respect."
    exp_closure_vpositive_3: "%NAME% sings out in sweet, satisfied tones. They rejoice
      at my presence."
    exp_closure_vpositive_4: "%NAME% has committed my identity to memory, our last
      conversation permanently recorded. They are delighted to greet me."
    exp_closure_vpositive_5: "%NAME%, honoring our previous interaction, greets me
      almost as an equal."
    exp_closure_positive_1: "%NAME% has no more words to exchange, but a happy pattern
      blinks upon their visor, an acknowledgement of our last conversation."
    exp_closure_positive_2: "%NAME%, uncertain of the greeting traditions of my species,
      but pleased to see me, performs an awkward little bow."
    exp_closure_positive_3: "%NAME% beeps affectionately, pleased to re-meet their
      favorite organic entity."
    exp_closure_positive_4: A welcoming pattern appears on %NAME%'s visor. They are
      more than willing to spare a few cycles to say hello.
    exp_closure_positive_5: "%NAME% pauses to shake my hand in greeting before returning
      to their own business."
    exp_closure_neutral_1: "%NAME% appears to face me, but their consciousness seems
      elsewhere, occupied with some task for the Convergence."
    exp_closure_neutral_2: "%NAME%'s visor gives no sign that they are aware of me,
      their digital face impassive."
    exp_closure_neutral_3: "%NAME% performs a perfunctory greeting, but says nothing
      more."
    exp_closure_neutral_4: "%NAME% performs a rapid scan, then dismisses me. They
      have no further utility for me."
    exp_closure_neutral_5: "%NAME% acknowledges me with a single, polite beep, but
      has nothing more to say."
    exp_closure_negative_1: "%NAME% exudes an aura of disapproval. They have no more
      time to waste on me."
    exp_closure_negative_2: "%NAME% is cold, silent, and intimidating. They do not
      wish to interact further."
    exp_closure_negative_3: "%NAME% shakes their head, refusing to spend further cycles
      engaging with me."
    exp_closure_negative_4: "%NAME% emits a low warning tone. Our last conversation
      has left them less than approachable."
    exp_closure_negative_5: "%NAME% flashes with hostility. Our last encounter is
      written into their memory, and cannot be revoked."
    exp_closure_vnegative_1: "<MOOD>Dead<>%NAME% shuts down entirely as I approach,
      utterly rejecting any attempt to engage them."
    exp_closure_vnegative_2: Though I cannot hear a tone, an uncomfortable pressure
      builds in my ears as I near %NAME%. I should leave their proximity, else risk
      physical damage.
    exp_closure_vnegative_3: The fury of multiple entities burns out from %NAME%'s
      facial lighting. Our previous encounter will not soon be forgotten.
    exp_closure_vnegative_4: "%NAME%'s rage feels organic and uncontrolled. Their
      shell rattles with displeasure at seeing me."
    exp_closure_vnegative_5: "%NAME% looks for a moment as though they might crush
      me with a single metallic blow. They blare at me to leave."
    exp_crashsite_wait: "%NAME% is lost in their own internal processes. Their speech
      interface is suspended as they await data regarding their ship."
    exp_scavenger_wait: "%NAME% seems almost oblivious to my presence, their senses
      tuned elsewhere. Perhaps I should investigate the damaged machinery they pointed
      out."
    dnt_exp_crashsite_lang_1: Eheu, Traveller! Dangerous pirates occupy system. Value
      advanced Korvax internals. Attacked. Ship broken. Stranded. Afraid.
    exp_crashsite_desc_1: |-
      This Korvax seems shaken, looking fearfully about themselves. They clutch protectively at their own body with trembling silicon hands, though I can see no signs of damage on the metal carapace.
      The hull of their ship, however, bears the unmistakable charring of plasma fire. Working through our communication barrier, I gather that this Korvax dares not leave this planet surface while whatever threatens them still orbits out there...
    exp_crashsite_opt_a_1: Offer assistance
    exp_crashsite_opt_b_1: Leave
    exp_crashsite_res_a_1: The Korvax's facial lighting beams with relief and gratitude
      as they parse my offer of assistance. They hastily transmit the malicious vessel's
      ID signature and last known location...
    exp_crashsite_res_b_1: Sensing my reluctance to help, the Korvax turns their fearful
      gaze back towards the skies, as though watching for pursuers.
    exp_crashsite_ret_desc_1: "%NAME% scans me nervously, still alert to the threat
      of attack. They await news of my space conflict."
    dnt_exp_crashsite_lang_2: Friend starship disconnected! Eheu! Eheu! Please find
      heartbeat, ship entity... persist...
    exp_crashsite_desc_2: The Korvax appears to be grieving the loss of a valued ship.
      Though the entity faces me, their awareness seems elsewhere. Instead, they appear
      to address the ship itself, muttering unintelligibly in rapid electronic tones.
    exp_crashsite_opt_a_2: Offer to investigate
    exp_crashsite_res_a_2: "%NAME% suddenly focuses on me, panicked. They indicate
      that the ship is theirs alone, and that physical interference would not be welcomed."
    exp_crashsite_ship_desc_2: |-
      On closer inspection, I notice several design similarities between the hull of the ship and the carapace of the nearby electronic lifeform. I wonder what the significance of the vessel is.
      The starship's failure can be narrowed down to a fault in the electrical insulation.
    exp_crashsite_ship_opt_a_2: Repair ship
    exp_crashsite_ship_res_a_2: I patch the breach in the ship's insulation, repairing
      a critical circuit that had shorted. The sparking ceases immediately.
    exp_crashsite_ship_opt_b_2: Leave it alone
    exp_crashsite_ship_res_b_2: I mentally note down the location of the insulation
      breach. Perhaps <STELLAR>this information<> will be revelatory to the Korvax.
    exp_crashsite_ret_desc_a_2: The Korvax continues to buzz and mumble. They may
      prove more communicative if I can help resolve their ship's malfunction, though
      they seem reluctant to allow me to repair it directly.
    exp_crashsite_ret_opt_a_2: Offer repair resources
    exp_crashsite_ret_res_a_2: |-
      %NAME% focuses in on me again, flashing happily. They accept the resources, and calculate an appropriate reward.
      I am forgotten, and they begin chittering towards their ship in a more buoyant tone. Listening closely, I am able to glean some new language skills.
    exp_crashsite_ret_desc_b_2: |-
      %NAME% seems conflicted. They are overjoyed to see their ship restored to health, but distressed by my physical interference.
      They calculate an appropriate reward, then dismiss me. They now wish to spend some quality time with their vessel.
    exp_crashsite_done_2: "%NAME% and their starship seem to share a unique bond.
      The Korvax is currently making up for lost time, addressing the vessel in soft
      tones, and pay no attention to anything else."
    dnt_exp_crashsite_lang_3: Traveller! Ship is volatile, dangerous! Electronic lifeform
      cannot approach.
    exp_crashsite_desc_3: This Korvax - presumably the pilot of the nearby starship
      - observes their vessel from a wary distance. They oscillate awkwardly, apparently
      conflicted between a desire to approach the ship, and fear for their safety.
    exp_crashsite_opt_a_3: Offer to investigate
    exp_crashsite_res_a_3: A soft alarm sounds from %NAME%, but they give their nervous
      approval.
    exp_crashsite_ship_desc_3: The ship's hull appears intact, but it is evident that
      something is very wrong. The vessel rattles ominously, and an unhealthy clicking
      sound echoes around the launch thrusters.
    exp_crashsite_ship_opt_a_3: Repair ship
    exp_crashsite_ship_res_a_3: |-
      I locate the source of the clicking sound, and gingerly reach into a repair hatch to attend to the volatile component.
      I am momentarily blinded by a discharge of light and heat. Pain flashes throughout my body: excruciating for a moment, and then abruptly gone.
      The explosion does not seem to have done any permanent damage, and the ship is now repaired.
    exp_crashsite_ret_desc_3: "%NAME% seems thankful to see me alive. The blast that
      merely singed me would no doubt have proven fatal to their electronic shell.
      They thank me, deftly repairing the damage to my suit before setting off."
    dnt_exp_crashsite_lang_4: Greetings, Unknown Entity! Difficult situation. Korvax
      carapace drained too much charge. Ship power depleted. Now...
    exp_crashsite_desc_4: The Korvax gestures despondently towards their ruined ship.
      The crumpled hull appears to have resulted from crash landing, not weapon fire.
      From a distance, it is impossible to determine the state of the internal components.
    exp_crashsite_opt_a_4: Offer to investigate
    exp_crashsite_res_a_4: As %NAME% gratefully accepts my offer, I notice a small
      silicon hatch hanging open on their side, close to their armpit. They notice
      where I am looking, and hurriedly snap the hatch closed.
    exp_crashsite_ship_desc_4: I can detect no physical damage to any of the components.
      However, trailing from the ship's cockpit are several cables that look suspiciously
      similar to the Korvax charging wires found at space stations.
    exp_crashsite_ship_opt_a_4: Refuel ship
    exp_crashsite_ship_opt_b_4: Transfer power from Exosuit
    exp_crashsite_ship_res_a_4: All the engines and drives are fully fueled. It is
      the ship's electronics that seem to have failed...
    exp_crashsite_ship_res_b_4: |-
      Struck by an idea, I carefully peel back the insulation from one of the trailing cables, and wire it into my Exosuit's life support system. There is a moment of tense silence.
      Suddenly, a loud, demanding beep sounds, and the dashboard display lights up. The ship's electronic subsystems have been restored to activity.
    exp_crashsite_ret_desc_4: The electronic lifeform thanks me profusely. They reward
      me generously for my help, throwing in a little extra for my discretion in this
      matter.
    dnt_exp_crashsite_lang_5: 'Unknown lifeform! A request: create new message signal?
      Ignore starship. Unknown lifeform lacks required technology knowledge for starship
      repair.'
    exp_crashsite_desc_5: |-
      A broken starship sparks nearby, but the Korvax gently draws my attention to their datapad instead. They run me through a series of very simple glyphs, frequently monitoring my expression to see if I've understood.
      I learn that the damaged ship technology is confidential to the Korvax Convergence. I don't possess the materials or the knowledge to repair it.
      However, %NAME% would offer compensation in exchange for pinpointing their shell's physical location. The construction of a <TECHNOLOGY>Communications Station<> would provide the broadcast they need.
    exp_crashsite_opt_a_5: Agree to help
    exp_crashsite_res_a_5: "%NAME%'s visor warms with approval. They seem undaunted
      by their predicament, but glad to have assistance. I wonder how long they have
      waited here."
    exp_crashsite_wait_5: "%NAME% barely acknowledges me. They appear to be attending
      to other matters while waiting for the requested <TECHNOLOGY>Communications
      Station<> to be constructed."
    exp_crashsite_ret_desc_5: "%NAME% reviews the phrasing of my message with interest.
      They nod with satisfaction, and produce a gift in return for my service to the
      Convergence."
    exp_crashsite_done_5: "%NAME% is focused inwardly, their neural network engaged
      in private conversation. They politely acknowledge my presence, but have nothing
      more to say to me."
    dnt_exp_crashsite_lang_6: 'Traveller lifeform! Greetings! Greetings! '
    exp_crashsite_desc_6: |-
      The Korvax hails me excitedly. I assume the nearby wreckage was, until recently, their personal starship. However, they seem remarkably unfazed by the crash, waving their hand dismissively when I gesture towards it.
      Instead, they enthusiastically point to their datapad. Multiple files cycle across the display, dense with dates and star charts, with specific planets and events highlighted. Repeated throughout is the image of an artifact.
    exp_crashsite_opt_a_6: Ask about star charts
    exp_crashsite_opt_b_6: Ask about artifact
    exp_crashsite_res_a_6: "%NAME% gestures to the landscape around us, and emphatically
      taps one of the highlighted planets. Evidently they are on course for their
      journey, even if their ship is temporarily out of action."
    exp_crashsite_res_b_6: "%NAME% seems impressed by my interest. They bring up a
      render of a modern Convergence Cube. The similarity to the artifact is unmistakable.
      It must be an ancient prototype of this now-essential Korvax device."
    exp_crashsite_ret_desc_6: 'The Korvax looks at me inquisitively, as though assessing
      something. They bring up one final image: a once-imposing building, ruined and

      They seem to suggest I can keep whatever I find, once they have extracted the
      essential data they require to continue their journey.
    exp_crashsite_wait_6: "%NAME% is busy studying their navigational documents. They
      remind me of the artifact they seek, promising to compensate me for my trouble."
    exp_crashsite_ret2_desc_6: I notice that %NAME% has repaired their ship in my
      absence. They clasp my hand in both of theirs, their facial lighting beaming.
      The silicon clinks against my Exosuit.

      acquired all the information they need. They thank me generously, now ready
      for the next step in their journey.
    dnt_exp_crashsite_lang_7: Eheu... entity friend... disconnected... eheu...
    exp_crashsite_desc_7: This Korvax is humming a plaintive musical phrase over and
      over. Their visor lights seem unfocused, and the feet and legs of their carapace
      are splattered with grime, as though they arrived at this distress beacon on
      foot.
    exp_crashsite_opt_a_7: Comfort
    exp_crashsite_res_a_7: |-
      I awkwardly try to comfort the grieving Korvax. They don't understand my words, but seem to appreciate the effort nonetheless.
      %NAME% gestures towards the nearby ship with a shaking hand. Their emotion, however it is generated, seems authentic.
    exp_crashsite_ship_desc_7: The starship has landed badly, its internals jolted
      by the collision. Even from outside, it is clear that the prospects for the
      pilot are grim.
    exp_crashsite_ship_opt_a_7: Look inside
    exp_crashsite_ship_res_a_7: 'The Korvax pilot is slumped over the dashboard: motionless,
      visor dark. A jagged tear in their carapace exposes the intricate wiring inside.'
    exp_crashsite_ship_ret_opt_a_7: Speak to pilot
    exp_crashsite_ship_ret_opt_b_7: Retrieve body
    exp_crashsite_ship_ret_res_a_7: The carapace is lifeless. This shell is badly
      damaged, and uninhabitable in its current state. The unique entity that once
      occupied it is gone forever.
    exp_crashsite_ship_ret_res_b_7: I gently lift the broken carapace from the wreckage.
    exp_crashsite_ret_desc_7: "%NAME% still hums their mournful refrain. I wonder
      whether they are representing the grief of the entire Korvax Convergence, or
      whether this attachment between two individual entities would be considered
      divergent."
    exp_crashsite_ret_opt_a_7: Give carapace
    exp_crashsite_ret_res_a_7: |-
      The Korvax pushes their friend's lifeless casing back into my hands, refusing to accept it. Instead, they offer a small gift - payment for transporting it to a better home, where it might be of use to another entity.
      %NAME% indicates that they would now like to be left alone.
    exp_crashsite_done_7: "%NAME% indicates that they would now like to be left alone."
    dnt_exp_crashsite_lang_8: 'Hello: Traveller! Ship oxygen system down! Carbon based
      cargo in peril!'
    exp_crashsite_desc_8: I have come across a Korvax pacing around a starship. They
      intermittently modify something on a datapad, seeming distressed by the results.
    exp_crashsite_opt_a_8: Offer assistance
    exp_crashsite_res_a_8: "%NAME% points desperately towards the ship. Whatever task
      they are attempting to perform remotely, it isn't working."
    exp_crashsite_ship_8: The starship is only superficially damaged; nothing prevents
      it from launching. However, curiously, a single crate of cargo seems to be stored
      in the cockpit itself.
    exp_crashsite_ship_opt_a_8: Examine cargo
    exp_crashsite_ship_opt_b_8: Listen to cargo
    exp_crashsite_ship_res_a_8: The crate seems to have been deliberately stored outside
      of the ship's hold, within easy reach of the pilot. An interface on the digital
      lock mechanism displays the universal symbol for oxygen, the light encircling
      it flashing red.
    exp_crashsite_ship_res_b_8: Listening closely, I can make out a muffled but frantic
      scratching sound.
    exp_crashsite_ship_ret_opt_a_8: Supply oxygen to crate
    exp_crashsite_ship_ret_opt_b_8: Extract oxygen from crate
    exp_crashsite_ship_ret_res_a_8: I refill the empty tank on the side of the crate,
      and the light on the lock display transitions from red to blue. The distressed
      scratching sounds cease immediately.
    exp_crashsite_ship_ret_res_a2_8: I refill the empty tank on the side of the crate,
      and the light on the lock display transitions from red to blue. I wonder how
      the Korvax pilot will react to this news.
    exp_crashsite_ship_ret_res_b_8: I withdraw a small amount of oxygen from the crate,
      but the supply seems almost depleted. The sounds from the crate become more
      audible, transitioning to a frenzied banging.
    exp_crashsite_ship_ret_res_b2_8: Getting closer to the lone piece of cargo, I
      can begin to make out a noise coming from within, like muffled scratching.
    exp_crashsite_ship_ret2_opt_b_8: Walk away
    exp_crashsite_ship_ret2_res_b_8: As I step away from the ship, I notice that the
      cockpit now seems completely silent.
    exp_crashsite_ret_desc_a_8: |-
      The Korvax thanks me repeatedly in their own language. For almost a full minute, they seem stuck in a gratitude loop, but finally resolve it by flooding my accounts with nanites.
      Whatever my gift of oxygen has preserved inside that crate, it is obviously dear to %NAME%.
    exp_crashsite_ret_desc_b_8: "%NAME% glares at me in furious disbelief. They refuse
      to engage in further communications."

      the same process again and again. They address me despairingly, desperate for
      any new input to break this deadlock.
    exp_scavenger_opt_a_3: Offer directions
    exp_scavenger_res_a_3: "%NAME% inserts the data directly into their carapace,
      their facial lighting immediately settling into a fresh pattern. They take a

      effectively ending our conversation."
    dnt_exp_scavenger_lang_4: "...Traveller entity?"
    exp_scavenger_desc_4: The Korvax scans me several times, trying to ascertain who
      I am, and whether I am alone. They seem caught off-guard. They hadn't anticipated
      that anyone else might venture out here.

      With some reluctance, %NAME% allows me to inspect their shell.
      I immediately identify the issue: a simple physical obstruction in their joints. I carefully scrape a number of ovoid objects from their carapace, then step back in revulsion as slug-like creatures hatch from the objects. They scatter quickly, leaving trails of viscous goo.

      If a Korvax could smile, %NAME% would be smiling now. Being here is effortless for them. Their mind is naturally attuned to the patterns of the storms, easily able to anticipate the fiercest downpours.
      Something about meeting a fellow explorer seems to have pleased them. In a sudden act of kindness, they give me a cluster of ionized crystals they have gathered.

      as they delicately grasp my arm and scan it. They seem satisfied with the results,
      and dismiss me with a nod.
    exp_filler_res_b_23: The Korvax is visibly disappointed, but does not attempt
      to seize my arm by force.
    exp_request_text_43: The lifeform was not expecting me to have a request of my
      own. They stop and listen.

      limitless.
    exp_filler_opt_a_25: Examine the cube

    exp_filler_res_a_25: I look closely at the datacube, but the patterns of light
      are meaningless to me.
    exp_filler_res_b_25: The datacube drops to the floor with a clatter. The Korvax
      emits a loud electronic buzz which I interpret as exasperation. I quickly take
      my leave.
    exp_request_text_45: "%NAME%'s visor lights up once more. They tilt their head,

      I am shown a vegetative sample that looks more mineral than flora. %NAME% presents a shard of reddish material, vine-like tendrils sprouting directly from a rock-like surface.
      They give my Multi-Tool a final suspicious look, and imply, with impassioned gestures, that I should leave the remainder of this planet's materials untouched.

      The Korvax seems heartened as they accept the Solanium, their entire demeanour shifting. They turn the crude organism over in their hands, marvelling at its simplicity.
      <PROP>HoloSolarSystem<>Illustrating their point holographically, they claim that everything, including this strange plant, has its place in the pattern of nature. Plants and creatures, entities such as the two of us, the Sentinels.

      %NAME% stares at my simple organic offering, skeptical. Finally, sufficiently desperate to improvise a solution, they slip the plant into a hatch on their side and plunge a wire into its icy flesh.
      The Korvax's carapace immediately cools, their disabled systems whirring to life. I have at least bought this entity a little more time. They thank me for my kindness with a gift.
    exp_npc_hot_ret_res_c_3: |-
      Via the physical entity before me, I address whatever portion of the Convergence is observing them. Perhaps the standing I have attained with the Korvax will lend credence to my input.

      Fine shavings of some synthetic material float in the air around this Korvax, dusting the floor and their boots. They seem excited, buzzing with the satisfaction of invention.
      Detecting my curiosity, the lifeform proudly shows me their custom suit modifications. Woven into the fibers enclosing their joints is a network of tiny solar cells. But some sections are not yet finished...

      dedicates their full processing power to crafting my requested upgrade. The
      task seems effortless, the tech ready almost instantly. Their debt repaid, they
      return to the more challenging matter of their suit, politely dismissing me.
    exp_npc_hot_desc_5: |-
      The Korvax pauses their work on a mechanical schematic. They welcome me with a genuine - if mildly patronizing - eagerness.
      They seem to be designing a water purification system, utilizing this planet's abundance of UV light.
      Contrasted against the precise engineering diagrams are several unnecessarily detailed illustrations of alien creatures. %NAME% seems to be in need of an organic sample.

      As they dip a silicon finger directly into the sample, the purifier blueprints on their datapad immediately populate with new information. %NAME% studies the completed dataset for a moment.
      Projecting a series of simple images into my visor, they consult me on the distribution of the purified water supply. I suspect I am a perceived member of their target demographic, no more evolved than a nonverbal creature.

    exp_npc_cold_opt_a_2: Offer botanical assistance
    exp_npc_cold_opt_b_2: Leave
    exp_npc_cold_res_a_2: The Korvax gives a single nod, pleased. They show the Frostwort
      again, prompting me to memorise its radiant blue petals, its striking crystal
      seeds. They require more of this substance to progress with their work.
    exp_npc_cold_res_b_2: The Korvax seems puzzled by my reluctance to help, but they
      quickly move on, dismissing me from their thoughts and presence.
    exp_npc_cold_farm_ret: When I return, %NAME% is observing something in an enclosed
      chamber. Their visor pulses with concentration, perhaps recording experiment
      results. They look up at me expectantly.
    exp_npc_cold_farm_ret_opt_a: Give samples
    exp_npc_cold_farm_ret_res_a: |-
      As the Korvax reaches out to accept the samples, I catch a glimpse inside their experiment box. A heat lamp radiates over a living vine of Frostwort.
      The plant is responding dramatically. It seems to shrivel away from the light, its radiance dulling, its cells bursting and collapsing. %NAME% watches with impartial fascination.
    exp_npc_cold_farm_ret2_opt_a: Protest
    exp_npc_cold_farm_ret2_res_a: |-
      The Korvax points out the Frostwort samples I have just delivered: torn from their root system, dying. Science cannot progress without sacrifice. They extract something from the tank before setting it aside.
      In one elegant motion, they strip the foliage from the fresh Frostwort, then pinch the central crystal between finger and thumb until it shatters.
      They deposit the naked seeds into my hand. These are to be replanted, redistributed, somewhere nearby, where they will thrive. Science is demanding, but it repays its debts.
    exp_npc_cold_farm_ret2_opt_b: Observe
    exp_npc_cold_farm_ret2_res_b: |-
      As the Frostwort withers, a yellowish gas begins to expand from the dead foliage. The Korvax extracts it into a canister, which they set aside. Their attention turns to the fresh samples.

      This Korvax's visor shines on me with an intense, analytical curiosity. I have the uneasy sense that they are extracting more data from me than I am conscious of displaying.
      %NAME% produces a container of fresh, clean snow. Slowly and deliberately, watching for my response, they slide their silicon hand deep into the snow. They then present the container to me, indicating I should mimic their actions.

    exp_npc_cold_res_a_3: I dip my suited fingers into the snow, my hazard protection
      neutralizing the temperature shift. There is a long moment of silent assessment.
      The Korvax observes my suit power draining, their digital expression inscrutable...
    exp_npc_cold_res_b_3: The Korvax pauses, then notes something down. Satisfied
      with whatever they have just learned, they dismiss me.
    exp_npc_cold_ret_opt_a_3: Bravely continue
    exp_npc_cold_ret_opt_b_3: Sensibly withdraw
    exp_npc_cold_ret_res_a_3: |-
      Overcoming the instinct to withdraw my hand, I remain still as the cold begins to penetrate my Exosuit. It is only when pain begins to shoot through my fingers that I finally retract them.
      The Korvax pats my arm sympathetically, and compensates me with something to aid survival. I have the impression they are questioning my ability to self-preserve.
    exp_npc_cold_ret_res_b_3: The Korvax seems impressed by this outcome, as though
      they'd expected something different. They reward me generously for my participation
      in their experiment.
    exp_npc_cold_desc_4: |-
      There is a subtle stiffness to the movements of this electronic lifeform, as though the joints of their shell aren't fully operational. Despite the low temperature of this facility, I detect a mild odor of burning silicon.
      %NAME% turns their visor towards me, their facial lighting subdued. A discreet cover on their carapace twists partway open, and then judders to a halt. The Korvax emits a long, despairing tone.
    dnt_exp_npc_cold_lang_4: Please, traveller. Carapace is pain, overheat even here.
      I am trapped. Disconnection of operational entity is forbidden by convergence.
      Eheu! Touch secret Gek interface, help me...
    exp_npc_cold_opt_a_4: Repair cover
    exp_npc_cold_res_a_4: I work lubricant into the jammed cover, which slides open
      to reveal a biometric sensor. Unable to activate it themselves, the Korvax awaits
      my input...

    exp_npc_cold_ret_opt_b_4: Activate sensor
    exp_npc_cold_ret_opt_c_4: Refuse

      effort, resumes their regular movement cycles. <MOOD>Sad<>The burning smell
      intensifies. They seem to be in distress...
    exp_npc_cold_ret_res_b_4: |-
      As I press a finger to the sensor, the lifeform's visor blinks with gratitude, then goes dark. It is unclear whether the entity within has been absorbed into the wider Korvax convergence, or has simply ceased.
      A cube clatters to the floor, perhaps containing the memories recorded by this shell.
    exp_npc_cold_ret_res_c_4: "%NAME% is dismayed, their malfunctioning carapace shuddering
      with artificial emotion. Then suddenly<MOOD>Neutral<>, ominously, they are calm,
      as though this exchange had never occurred. I receive units from an unknown
      benefactor."
    exp_npc_cold_desc_5: The lifeform jerks, startled from a reverie. As their attention
      focuses on me, I begin to feel strangely entwined with them, as though I am
      sharing their perspective, observing my own anomalous presence through Korvax
      eyes.
    dnt_exp_npc_cold_lang_5: Traveller! Eheu! I was busy. But now you are here, enjoy

      worth of populations ascending and descending, environmental wounds healing,
      cyclical snowfall resetting the terrain to exquisite neutrality.
    exp_npc_cold_res_b_5: I attempt to reject the foreign presence from my mind. Sensing
      my resistance, the Korvax allows themselves to be expelled, shaking their head
      sadly. They teach me a word of their language, as though hoping to guide me
      towards wiser choices in the future.

    exp_npc_lush_farm_ret_opt_a: Give samples
    exp_npc_lush_farm_ret_res_a: The Korvax takes the samples reverently. They scan
      each bulb from multiple angles, savoring every visual detail. As a fresh perfume
      filters into my suit, I wonder whether the electronic lifeform also has olfactory
      senses.
    exp_npc_lush_farm_ret2_opt_a: Ask about smell
    exp_npc_lush_farm_ret2_res_a: |-
      %NAME% seems to understand the gist of my question. They babble affirmatively, attempting to describe the nuances of the perfume's chemistry.
      I must look blank, as they soon give up. In a simplified demonstration, they toggle some inner valve, gesturing as it clicks open, then closed, then open again. It seems they can smell, or not, as they choose.
      Eager to proceed, they insert the Star Bulbs into a hand-held centrifuge. The bramble spins violently, seeds shaken from a flurry of petals. These seeds are given to me, ready to plant outside.

      a limb in its socket, troubled by some nuance of its movement."
    exp_npc_dust_ret_3: The Korvax is still for a moment, then expels a fine cloud
      of dust from a number of ventilation ducts. They seem to be modifying their
      carapace airflow to more efficiently remove grit, but with limited success.
    exp_npc_dust_ret_opt_a_3: Ask about the grit

      The Korvax examines a screen of stats from a local species of fauna. The interface resembles my Exosuit's discovery database, but is richer in scientific detail. In addition to general diet and behavior descriptors, the creature's digestive system and various adaptive traits are fully simulated.
      They pass a digital eye over me, and reach out to gently touch my exosuit. They seem curious: why do the local creatures not require this nano-fiber skin? Am I less evolved? A cruder lifeform?
    dnt_exp_npc_tox_lang_3: Unknown entity wears synthetic shell over organic flesh.
      Interesting. Cannot process toxins? Local creatures superior entities?

      dismay that it is naked), I draw attention to my brain's neural tracts, far
      denser than the creature's. My physical advantages are simply different, not
      lesser.
    exp_npc_tox_ret_3: |-
      %NAME% tilts their head, considering. Korvax shells have progressed linearly towards a rounded ideal, valuing both physical durability and processing power. This idea of diverse evolution is alien to them.
      If my morphology is so ill-equipped for this planet, they wonder, why am I here, so far from home?
    exp_npc_tox_ret_opt_a_3: Say you don't remember home
    exp_npc_tox_ret_opt_b_3: Say you are a Traveler
    exp_npc_tox_ret_res_a_3: |-
      As far as I can read the electronic lifeform's faceless expression, they seem saddened. The memory of the Korvax homeworld is woven inextricably into their consciousness. They have always remembered home.
      In sympathy, they gift me an exosuit upgrade. With this, I might journey further, and perhaps - eventually - remember home.
    exp_npc_tox_ret_res_b_3: The Korvax's facial mask glitters. They incline their
      head, almost deferently, and gift me fuel to further my travels.
    exp_npc_rad_desc_2: |-
      The Korvax tilts their helmet towards some native flora, their facial lighting shimmering with pleasure. They almost seem to be listening to the plant, though whatever they might be hearing is inaudible to my senses.
      Humming a soft tone, they point to the plant, then to the terrain outside. They seem to want more of these roots, and are <STELLAR>asking for my assistance<>.

      %NAME% is pleased, but overwhelmed, by the Gamma Root heaped before them. Again, they seem to listen to the plants, raising their hands to their helmet as though focusing through a cacophony.
      Methodically, they select just three specimens. Almost too quickly to follow, a slender needle emerges from their palm and scoops a seed from each blossom. The needle retracts. They drop the seeds into my palm.

    exp_npc_rad_farm_ret2_res_a: |-
      %NAME% looks sympathetic as they finally realize I cannot detect the sounds they hear. They incline their head towards me, seeking some form of permission, then suddenly my reality seems to roil and bubble.
      Temporarily granted a Korvax perspective, I can finally hear it. Soft tones sing out from the roots, undulating with the radiation waves.
      The music fades as %NAME% gently severs our connection. They gesture outside. I should plant these seeds in a location of my choice.

    exp_npc_rad_ret_res_a_3: The Korvax's digital eye bores into me. The fossil is
      priceless to a scientist - but they would happily pass it on to a fellow researcher,
      someone dedicated to full-time study, who seeks knowledge over profit.
    exp_npc_rad_ret2_opt_a_3: Take fossil to sell
    exp_npc_rad_ret2_opt_b_3: Decline
    exp_npc_rad_ret2_res_a_3: To an explorer, the fossil's only value is monetary.
      However, the Korvax seems innocent to this, and willingly hands it over.

      Knowing I cannot dedicate my life to science, I bypass the opportunity to take this valuable fossil. The Korvax seems grateful for my honesty.
      I have the unshakable feeling of being watched, by something larger even than the Convergence. A sourceless voice whispers in my head, and a new word takes shape.

      This Korvax seems to be a freshly conscious entity, still acclimatizing to the physical shell they have inherited. They flex and wriggle their limbs experimentally.
      An embarrassed warble escapes them. Their carapace is not yet as they would like - the enhancements are outdated, the technology obsolete. They had hoped to be seen by as few lifeforms as possible before upgrading.

      For a moment, there is an echo of a different entity before me, a different consciousness. Perhaps a trace of the shell's previous occupant is still preserved within the Korvax neural network, haunting their old metal skin.
      %NAME% wrests back control. Their eye seems to spin a little faster, their clock speed racing. They regard me curiously, as though contemplating what a one-use body must be like.

      The Korvax taps the numbers by the symbol, then motions towards my equipment. They seem to be recording the popularity of Korvax technology, collaborating with other entities to create an intergalactic dataset.

      The Korvax notices what I am doing, and taps their finger against mine, sixteen times. They give me a meaningful look, and provide some ship technology, that I might one day visit these systems first-hand.
    exp_npc_obs_ret_res_b_1: |-
      The crimson light is mesmerising, hypnotic. I suspect it is not a star at all, not in the conventional sense, but there is a familiar pull to it, as though it is recalling me to some place I cannot remember...
      The Korvax notices my fixation, and looks sympathetic. They proivde some ship technology, that I might one day visit the crimson star first hand.

      They seem to have already decided they can trust me, and gesture towards the observatory's terminal. I am invited me to inspect its findings for myself.
    exp_npc_obs_res_b_2: |-
      I peer at %NAME%'s datapad, trying to see the display for myself. The Korvax appears to be tracking ship activity in a remote location, collating data in preparation to make a decision.
      The electronic lifeform notices what I am doing, and gestures towards the observatory's terminal. I am invited me to inspect its findings for myself.
    exp_npc_obs_wait_2: "%NAME% is lost in thought. Data seems to flow seamlessly
      between the facility equipment, the Korvax's datapad, and their own electronic
      interface. The terminal I was invited to inspect may reveal more..."

      This observatory has been tuned to the same range of frequencies for years. Whoever originally attended this equipment is long gone. Their objectives can only be guessed at.
      However, a consistent pattern of interference has emerged over the years - a glitchy pattern of electromagnetic waves, oddly high on the spectrum, originating from a specific point in deep space.

    exp_term_obs_res_a_2: |-
      The terminal begins to project a scratchy, disjointed video. The clips are a series of memories, apparently patched together from the minds of individual Korvax pilots.
      Each clip shows a glimpse of an anomalous section of space. It is a deeply unsettling strip of nothingness, like a gap in reality. As it comes into view, the clips end abruptly, as though the Korvax mind has been disconnected.
      In many of the memories, ghost ships can be seen drifting away from the location, manned only by empty carapaces. No living Korvax seem to return from the breach.
    exp_term_obs_res_b_2: |-
      The terminal begins to emit a scratchy, disjointed series of audio clips, apparently patched together from the memories of individual Korvax pilots.
      Each begins with the ambience of solo starship flight, before a terrible distortion overwhelms the clip. It mingles with the screams of Korvax, their voices rising and splintering before suddenly falling silent.

      %NAME% reaches out to touch me, as though questioning whether I am here, whether I am solid. From their shaken manner, it is immediately apparent that they have witnessed all that I accessed on the terminal.
      They have a complicated decision to weigh in on, and seem to want my input. I am presented with the options their collective are considering. What would a member of my species suggest?

      my empathy. They hand me something before I depart.
    exp_npc_obs_ret_res_b_2: The Korvax casts their vote to investigate with a biological
      pilot, hoping they will prove immune to the breach. There is a moment of silence,

      as they merge their consciousness with that of the ship. They seem fulfilled
      by their occupation.
    exp_npc_freighter_desc_3: The crewmember's facial lighting glows hot as they endeavour
      to process what they are seeing, their cooling system compensating audibly.
    exp_npc_freighter_desc_4: The Korvax is repeatedly scanning the cargo aboard this
      freighter, taking inventory again and again. Perhaps this is their duty as a
      crewmember, or perhaps the cargo has some personal meaning for them.
    exp_npc_freighter_desc_5: I feel a multitude of entities watching through the
      eye of this electronic lifeform. I have the surreal, dizzying sense of infinite
      freighters warping through infinite galaxies, with infinite Korvax eyes all

      talking.
    war_closure_neutral_5: "%NAME% looks bored. They try to remain polite, but have
      clearly tired of chatter."
    war_closure_negative_1: "%NAME%'s breathing slows to a deep, intimidating growl.
      Remembering our last unpleasant encounter, they tremble with the effort not
      to strike me."
    war_closure_negative_2: "%NAME% casts me a formidable glare. They seem deeply
      unimpressed with how our last conversation ended, and have no wish to converse
      again."

      been fully exhausted by our last encounter."

      The Vy'keen roars approvingly. They provide an electronic description of an enemy vessel, as well as the coordinates of the violent encounter that led them to this point.
      The pertinent information conveyed, the warrior fixes me with a blank stare until I leave.
    war_crashsite_res_b_1: The Vy'keen shakes their head in disbelief. I feel myself
      wither slightly under their disapproval.
    war_crashsite_wait_1: "%NAME% seems disinterested in further conversation. They
      wait for news of their enemy's defeat."
    war_crashsite_ret_1: "%NAME% looks at me expectantly, hoping my space battle ended
      in victory."
    dnt_war_crashsite_lang_2: Starship is weak, pathetic! Robot flee and starship
      choose death! Pathetic! The robot must still be halted and destroyed. Grah!
    war_crashsite_desc_2: The Vy'keen seems both ragged with exhaustion, and inconsolably
      furious. They are unsteady on their feet, with the disoriented manner of someone
      who has flown for days without rest. Whatever or whoever they were pursuing,
      it doesn't seem to be nearby.
    war_crashsite_opt_a_2: Offer sustenance
    war_crashsite_opt_b_2: Ask about ship
    war_crashsite_res_a_2: Rage bubbles up in the warrior, perceiving insult in the
      kindly-meant gesture. It was not their own weakness or hunger that landed them
      here! It was the weakness of their ship!
    war_crashsite_res_b_2: "%NAME% makes a vulgar gesture towards their starship,
      seeming to resent it for failing them. I am welcome to investigate, it seems."
    war_crashsite_ship_desc_2: |-
      The starship is only lightly damaged, its navigation still actively targeting coordinates in a nearby system. Judging by the movement of the target, it is almost certainly another ship, perhaps only one hyperdrive jump away.
      A cursory examination reveals that both the launch thrusters and hyperdrive have been drained of fuel. It seems a simple empty tank is the source of all the warrior's frustration.
    war_crashsite_ship_opt_a_2: Fuel launch thruster
    war_crashsite_ship_res_a_2: The launch thruster is refueled. The ship is no longer
      grounded, and any further maintenance can be carried out at a space station
      or trade outpost.
    war_crashsite_ship_opt_b_2: Fuel both
    war_crashsite_ship_res_b_2: Both the launch thruster and the hyperdrive are now
      fueled. The ship is fully prepared to navigate directly to its target coordinates.
    war_crashsite_ret_desc_a_2: "%NAME% roars with thanks, gifting me some of their
      cargo. I try to explain that they should dock somewhere to refuel their hyperdrive,
      but I am not sure they understand. Their focus has returned to their pursuit,
      eyes glittering with bloodlust."
    war_crashsite_ret_desc_b_2: "%NAME% roars with thanks, gifting me a generous portion
      of their cargo. Their ship is strong again. Their target's cowardly flight has
      come to an end. The Vy'keen's eyes glitter with bloodlust."
    dnt_war_crashsite_lang_3: Weak-minded beak coward! I trade good units, you trade
      vessel with unacceptable malfunction! Death! Death! Death!
    war_crashsite_desc_3: The Vy'keen is screaming into a communications device. A
      SalesGek blusters on the other end, their oily apprehension visible even on
      the small screen.
    war_crashsite_opt_a_3: Ask about Gek
    war_crashsite_opt_b_3: Listen
    war_crashsite_res_a_3: "%NAME% turns fiercely. They seem to rage at me, the Gek,
      themselves, and the nearby ruined ship all at once. The Gek on the communicator
      defends themselves shrilly, adding to the cacophony."
    war_crashsite_res_b_3: The two lifeforms shout over each other, neither pausing
      to listen. The Vy'keen's tone is accusatory, the Gek's defensive. Several times,
      %NAME% rattles the datapad and points to the nearby ruined ship.
    war_crashsite_ret_desc_3: The details of the argument are unclear, but the Vy'keen's
      starship is certainly involved. Investigating it directly may be more productive
      than engaging with this bickering.
    war_crashsite_ship_desc_3: The ship's components are much newer than its hull.
      Someone has done a reasonable refurbishment job, but one safety gyro was installed
      cheaply, and has rattled loose. The Vy'keen was lucky to walk away unscathed.
    war_crashsite_ship_opt_a_3: Reinstall gyroscope
    war_crashsite_ship_res_a_3: I refit the gyroscope with a more appropriate adhesive.
      With the stabilization features restored, the ship is safe to fly again.
    war_crashsite_ret2_3: |-
      The Vy'keen stares in happy disbelief at their repaired ship. The SalesGek attempts to disconnect the call, but falters when the warrior bares their teeth menacingly.
      %NAME% brings up a holographic schematic of the ship, the components exploded out for easy identification. They seem to want me to indicate the faulty part. On the video feed, the SalesGek looks nervous.
    war_crashsite_ret2_opt_a_3: Describe ship fault
    war_crashsite_ret2_res_a_3: |-
      I point out the faulty component, exposing where the ship's safety was compromised. The Gek reacts hastily, transferring %NAME% a large number of units, then abruptly cutting communications.
      <MOOD>VeryPositive<>%NAME% suddenly seems amused by the situation. They let loose a chuckle, and share some of their cargo with me in thanks.
    war_crashsite_ret2_opt_b_3: Just tell them it's fixed
    war_crashsite_ret2_res_b_3: |-
      I shrug off the question, implying that the problem is resolved, and not worth dwelling on. The SalesGek's relief is tangible.
      %NAME% pays me for my assistance, seeming calmer. A moment later, more units hit my account from an anonymous source.
    war_crashsite_desc_4: I seem to have jolted the Vy'keen out of a trance. They
      compose themselves and address me politely. Their hulking muscles are poised
      with perfect civility.
    dnt_war_crashsite_lang_4: |-
      ...
      <MOOD>Neutral<>Grah! You are the one I await, the interloper. Our ancestors speak of your allegiance to the Vy'keen in the great war. Together we fight the sentinel plague!
    war_crashsite_desc2_4: "%NAME% has the quiet focus of someone who has been fighting
      a war for a very long time. They seem highly trained, and deadly. They may never
      have known any other life."
    war_crashsite_opt_a_4: Ask why they are out here
    war_crashsite_opt_b_4: Ask about crashed ship
    war_crashsite_res_a_4: The Vy'keen shares some footage. I recognize %NAME% themselves
      in the video, but with none of their present serenity. They stand atop a shattered
      sentinel walker, laughing maniacally, firing their Multi-Tool into the air.
    war_crashsite_res_b_4: "%NAME% turns to face their ship, and sighs. Their journey
      has been halted by an equipment failure - and they are a warrior, not a mechanic.
      They offer cargo in exchange for any help..."
    war_crashsite_ship_desc_4: This unglamorous vessel has been worn down by decades
      of daily use. The ship looks cared for - the weapons, especially, have been
      well-maintained - but some parts appear to have corroded over time.
    war_crashsite_ship_opt_a_4: Remove corrosion
    war_crashsite_ship_res_a_4: Fortunately, the rust is only superficial, and has
      not eaten far into the components. I carefully lift the corrosion from the affected
      parts, restoring functionality to several connectors.
    war_crashsite_ship_opt_b_4: Replace part
    war_crashsite_ship_res_b_4: I replace the corroded parts with fresh metal sheeting,
      ensuring there will be no need to revisit them for some time.
    war_crashsite_ret_desc_a_4: "%NAME% seems fascinated by my simple maintenance
      technique, apparently learning a new skill for themselves. They honor me with
      a substantial gift."
    war_crashsite_ret_desc_b_4: "%NAME% looks at me with a deep respect. Despite their
      obvious military skill, basic engine maintenance seems to elude them. They reward
      me gratefully."
    dnt_war_crashsite_lang_5: Honourable interloper! I offer greetings with greatest
      pleasure. A tiny problems with my starship - help will be rewarded!
    war_crashsite_desc_5: The warrior greets me with a rough immediacy, yanking my
      hand forward to shake it. They seem pleased to have company, and very willing
      to share some of the valuables they carry - in return for help with their broken
      ship.
    war_crashsite_opt_a_5: Offer assistance
    war_crashsite_res_a_5: "%NAME% barks with laughter. They are very glad to have
      encountered me."
    war_crashsite_ship_desc_5: The ship is Vy'keen military issue, though the insignia
      is so plastered with grime that the regiment is impossible to identify. The
      hull bears the scars of dozens - possibly hundreds - of dogfights. Plasma fire
      has completely sliced through part of the wing.
    war_crashsite_ship_opt_a_5: Repair hull
    war_crashsite_ship_res_a_5: The damage to the wing is extensive, but not irreparable.
      Once repaired, the patched-up section barely stands out from the rest of the
      ship's wear and tear.
    war_crashsite_ship_opt_b_5: Examine cargo
    war_crashsite_ship_res_b_5: Stealthily, I peer into the cargo hold. Crates of
      valuables are stacked high - all legally-tradable goods, with the exception
      of one small box, stashed conspicuously under a sheet. It seems unlikely that
      these substances were legitimately acquired.
    war_crashsite_ret_desc_5: "%NAME% greets me warmly, impressed by my repair job.
      They lazily proffer the promised reward. It looks rare, and valuable."
    war_crashsite_ret_opt_a_5: Accept reward
    war_crashsite_ret_res_a_5: The Vy'keen looks smug as they hand me my payment.
      I have the spine-chilling sensation of being watched...
    war_crashsite_ret_opt_b_5: Report crime
    war_crashsite_ret_res_b_5: |-
      I radio my coordinates to the system authorities. A bounty payout is transferred immediately to my accounts - it seems they have been hunting this notorious pirate for months.
      %NAME% is furious, and immediately flees the planet.
    dnt_war_crashsite_lang_6: My warriors all lost... The darkness, the beast, it
      got into my starship... no escape for three moons...
    war_crashsite_desc_6: The warrior seems unnerved. Everything from their posture
      to their attire indicates a high military rank, but their squadron is nowhere
      to be seen. They avoid their starship, as though they cannot bear to get too
      close...
    war_crashsite_opt_a_6: Offer to investigate
    war_crashsite_res_a_6: "%NAME% just looks worried."
    war_crashsite_ship_desc_6: An eerie whispering is coming from inside the cockpit...
    war_crashsite_ship_opt_a_6: Open the cockpit
    war_crashsite_ship_res_a_6: The whispering becomes clearer as I begin to ease
      the cockpit open. It crescendos into a ear-splitting croak, then something acidic
      splats against my visor. I snap the door closed.
    war_crashsite_ship_opt_b_6: Shoot through a crack
    war_crashsite_ship_res_b_6: Opening the cockpit just a crack, I quickly fire my
      Multi-Tool just once, then slam the door shut. Something inside hisses angrily.
      The whispering seems faster now.
    war_crashsite_ship_ret_opt_a_6: Shoot again
    war_crashsite_ship_ret_res_a_6: This time, the shot seems to find its mark. There
      is a single gurgling scream, and a green liquid splatters the cockpit window
      and my Multi-Tool. Silence follows.
    war_crashsite_ret_desc_6: "%NAME% is writhing slightly, as though uncomfortable
      in their Exosuit. They say nothing, but the question in their eyes is clear."
    war_crashsite_ret_opt_a_6: Nod
    war_crashsite_ret_opt_b_6: Show Multi-Tool
    war_crashsite_ret_res_a_6: "%NAME% nods gruffly in response, barely holding some
      emotion at bay. They reward me extra for my silence regarding this incident."
    war_crashsite_ret_res_b_6: "%NAME% takes in the spatter on my weapon's barrel,
      and relaxes slightly. They reward me extra for my silence regarding this incident."
    dnt_war_crashsite_lang_7: How many moons am I expected to wait? Be faster, pathetic
      recruit! Do your duty with the starship!
    war_crashsite_desc_7: The Vy'keen warrior holds themselves with a practiced dignity.
      They sneer slightly as I approach, with the impatience of a high-ranking officer
      unused to being kept waiting. They gesture languidly towards their ship.
    war_crashsite_opt_a_7: Ask if they want help
    war_crashsite_opt_b_7: Punch them
    war_crashsite_res_a_7: "%NAME% stares at me blankly. They wonder why I am still
      here gabbing, instead of fixing their ship."
    war_crashsite_res_b_7: "%NAME% rolls their eyes. They then throw a return punch
      with twice the strength of mine, and look pointedly at the still broken ship."
    war_crashsite_ship_desc_7: The starship has been thoroughly beaten up in a skirmish
      with at least one other vessel, though the damage looks easily repairable. I
      wonder how many others this ship took down before its own systems finally gave
      way.
    war_crashsite_ship_opt_a_7: Conceal pungent materials
    war_crashsite_ship_res_a_7: Completing the trivial repair job, I also deposit
      a small handful of organic matter in the ship's life support system, as a surprise
      for the haughty Vy'keen after a few hours of flight.
    war_crashsite_ship_opt_b_7: Just repair the ship
    war_crashsite_ship_res_b_7: The repairs are trivial, taking almost no time. The
      Vy'keen's ship is ready to return to the skies.
    war_crashsite_ret_desc_a_7: I allow myself a small smile.
    war_crashsite_ret_desc_b_7: The Vy'keen grunts at me. They issue a payment for
      the repair, ready to be on their way.
    dnt_war_crashsite_lang_8: Who will find death for this? Recruit one, two, three,
      four? Brothers honour destroyed! Death! Death! Death! Death! Grah!
    war_crashsite_desc_8: The Vy'keen mutters to themselves furiously. They seem to
      be running through a list of possibilities, counting off each item on a finger.
      The ship nearby must belong to them, but it doesn't currently appear functional...
    war_crashsite_opt_a_8: Ask about list
    war_crashsite_opt_b_8: Ask about ship
    war_crashsite_res_a_8: "%NAME% suspends their counting. They slowly raise a finger
      to point directly at me, almost in accusation, but then dismiss the thought.
      Their ship's disrepair, they indicate, is not accidental - they are sure of
      it."
    war_crashsite_ship_desc_8: Foul-smelling smoke rises from somewhere deep inside
      the starship, but the source is not immediately obvious. Waving the particles
      aside, tracing them back to their origin, I locate a shard of metal that looks
      out of place.
    war_crashsite_ship_opt_a_8: Extract metal
    war_crashsite_ship_opt_b_8: Use insulation to extract
    war_crashsite_ship_res_a_8: A painful force jolts through my Exosuit and into
      my nerves. My hand instinctively releases the shard.
    war_crashsite_ship_res_b_8: |-
      I carefully extract the shard from the board it obstructs. Despite the obvious short-circuit, nothing appears to have melted.
      I realize the item is a Vy'keen dagger. An aggressive-looking sequence of glyphs is hand-carved into its handle.
    war_crashsite_ret_desc_8: "%NAME% barely seems to register the repair of their
      starship. Instead, they seem fixated on the why of it - the identity of the
      saboteur. There is a crazed, bloodthirsty look in their eyes."
    war_crashsite_ret_opt_a_8: Show dagger
    war_crashsite_ret_opt_b_8: Shake head
    war_crashsite_ret_res_a_8: The Vy'keen explodes with fury as they lay eyes on
      the carved glyphs. They reward me generously for exposing this targeted sabotage.
      As they grip their Multi-Tool with white-knuckled rage, I suspect I have just
      condemned someone to a violent end.
    war_crashsite_ret_res_b_8: I shake my head, giving nothing away. The Vy'keen looks
      confused - and then deflated, appearing to debate their own sanity. They honor
      my help with an appropriate payment.
    dnt_war_scavenger_lang_1: Suit is pathetic for such a strong interloper. I will
      charge. Hirk protect you! Grah!
    war_scavenger_hot_desc_1: The Vy'keen seems at peace out here, despite the heat
      blazing down on us. They grunt a greeting, and - apparently doubting my own
      endurance skills - freely recharge my hazard protection.
    war_scavenger_cold_desc_1: The Vy'keen seems at peace out here, despite the freezing
      winds whipping around us. They grunt a greeting, and - apparently doubting my
      own endurance skills - freely recharge my hazard protection.
    war_scavenger_lush_desc_1: The Vy'keen seems at peace out here, at one with the
      elements. They grunt a greeting, and - apparently doubting my own endurance
      skills - freely recharge my life support.
    war_scavenger_dust_desc_1: The Vy'keen seems at peace out here, despite their
      complete exposure to the elements. They grunt a greeting, and - apparently doubting
      my own endurance skills - freely recharge my hazard protection.
    war_scavenger_tox_desc_1: The Vy'keen seems at peace out here, despite the toxic
      spores lining the joints of their suit. They grunt a greeting, and - apparently
      doubting my own endurance skills - freely recharge my hazard protection.
    war_scavenger_rad_desc_1: The Vy'keen seems at peace out here, despite the obvious
      contamination of this planet's terrain. They grunt a greeting, and - apparently
      doubting my own endurance skills - freely recharge my hazard protection.
    war_scavenger_opt_a_1: Leave with thanks
    war_scavenger_res_a_1: "%NAME% nods solemnly."
    dnt_war_scavenger_lang_2: Many resources here! I make plans for next site to harvest.
      Please accept gift for interloper.
    war_scavenger_hot_desc_2: |-
      The Vy'keen's brow relaxes as they greet me, their concentration easing off. They glisten slightly in the heat, a sign they have been laboring out here for some time.
      They must have enjoyed success with their mining, however. In an act of simple generosity, they offer me some of their surplus.
    war_scavenger_cold_desc_2: |-
      The Vy'keen's brow relaxes as they greet me, their concentration easing off. Their heavy breath forms thick clouds of steam in the bracing air. They seem to have been laboring out here for some time.

    war_scavenger_tox_desc_2: |-

    dnt_war_scavenger_lang_3: I must secure system defence... information operations
      cannot end with me... grah! Where are we, interloper?
    war_scavenger_desc_3: The Vy'keen broadens their stance aggressively as they speak,
      but their trembling limbs give away their exhaustion. They seem entirely alone
      out here, with no ship or exocraft in sight.
    war_scavenger_opt_a_3: Offer directions
    war_scavenger_res_a_3: "%NAME% wastes no time in decrypting the data, but something
      in the output seems to distress them. Distractedly, they reward me for the help,
      but then absorb themselves completely in this new information, making agitated
      notes on their datapad."
    dnt_war_scavenger_lang_4: "...Interloper?"
    war_scavenger_desc_4: The Vy'keen reels backwards as I approach them. They seem
      startled by the presence of another intelligent lifeform, and unsure of how
      to behave. Their voice is rough, as though it has not been used in weeks.
    war_scavenger_opt_a_4: Reassure them
    war_scavenger_opt_b_4: Ask what they are doing
    war_scavenger_res_a_4: |-
      %NAME% doesn't seem to take in my words, instead assessing the Multi-Tool I carry. They relax, persuaded that I am no threat.
      They reveal their scrap metal haul, salvaged from abandoned crates and machinery. The pod nearby, they indicate, has proven problematic - they have gained only partial access to its contents. I am invited to try it myself...
    war_scavenger_res_b_4: |-
      %NAME% glares suspiciously. They size me up, the silence stretching between us.
      Finally, they seem to relax.
      They reveal their scrap metal haul, salvaged from abandoned crates and machinery. The pod nearby, they indicate, has proven problematic - they have gained only partial access to its contents. I am invited to try it myself...
    war_scavenger_debris_4: 'The purpose of the pod is unclear, but the source of
      the Vy''keen''s curiosity is obvious: a closed chamber on the side of the device.
      The hatch remains firmly sealed, despite the numerous scratches left by attempts
      to open it.'
    war_scavenger_debris_opt_a_4: Prise open chamber
    war_scavenger_debris_opt_b_4: Touch display
    war_scavenger_debris_res_a_4: Even using my Multi-Tool for leverage, the hatch
      doesn't budge. The device's interface, however, beeps in protest.
    war_scavenger_debris_res_b_4: |-
      The display responds dramatically the moment my hand makes contact. Several screens of messages flash past too quickly to make out, but I catch something about biometrics.
      The hatch slides open, and an ominous ticking begins to sound. I have just enough time to reach in and grab the contents of the chamber; on the sixteenth tick, the hatch slams closed, and the pod is again silent.
    war_scavenger_ret_desc_4: "%NAME% seems surprised by my return, as though they'd
      forgotten anyone else was here."
    war_scavenger_ret_opt_a_4: Offer metals
    war_scavenger_ret_opt_b_4: Keep metals
    war_scavenger_ret_res_a_4: The Vy'keen is impressed by my salvaging. They accept
      the metals and, in fair exchange, offer a Multi-Tool module they have developed
      themselves. The formality feels out of place in these surroundings - but the
      upgrade looks valuable.
    war_scavenger_ret_res_b_4: The Vy'keen is impressed by my salvaging, and respects
      my right to keep what I have found.
    dnt_war_scavenger_lang_5: This body is old, interloper. I must end this life in
      the way of tradition. Please leave. I want no eyes upon this ceremony.
    war_scavenger_desc_5: Unlike so many of their species, there is no trace of violence
      in %NAME%. Instead, they move slowly, somberly, as though they contemplate some
      heavy burden. I sense that they wish to be left alone.
    dnt_war_scavenger_lang_6: Foolish interloper! Protect your pathetic life, return
      to facility.
    war_scavenger_desc_6: The bulky warrior stifles a laugh. They attempt politeness,
      but seem to find my presence out here entertaining. They hand me some navigation
      data, smirking slightly.
    war_scavenger_opt_a_6: Accept with thanks
    war_scavenger_opt_b_6: Refuse help
    war_scavenger_res_a_6: "%NAME% pats me on the shoulder."

    war_scavenger_hot_desc_7: The warrior is panting with exertion. They seem to be
      practicing their survival skills, building up their endurance to the heat. Frustration
      shows on their face. Perhaps their training is not going as well as they'd like.
    war_scavenger_cold_desc_7: The warrior is panting with exertion. They seem to

      Frustration shows on their face. Perhaps their training is not going as well
      as they'd like.
    war_scavenger_dust_desc_7: The warrior is panting with exertion. They seem to
      be practicing their survival skills, building up their endurance to the changing
      temperatures. Frustration shows on their face. Perhaps their training is not
      going as well as they'd like.
    war_scavenger_tox_desc_7: The warrior is panting with exertion. They seem to be
      practicing their survival skills, building up their endurance to toxins. Frustration
      shows on their face. Perhaps their training is not going as well as they'd like.
    war_scavenger_rad_desc_7: The warrior is panting with exertion. They seem to be
      practicing their survival skills, building up their endurance to radiation.
      Frustration shows on their face. Perhaps their training is not going as well
      as they'd like.
    war_scavenger_opt_a_7: Give oxygen
    war_scavenger_opt_b_7: Give life support gel
    war_scavenger_res_a_7: "%NAME% recharges their suit's life support. They seem
      reinvigorated, if slightly abashed for accepting help from a stranger. They
      give me a token of thanks before returning to their training."

      journey despair. This is not the homeworld. Leave me...
    war_scavenger_desc_8: |-
      The Vy'keen stirs from a trance, startled to see another lifeform. Their eyes slide over me questioningly, seeming to debate my identity. Is it a sign, an omen, that they have encountered me out here in the wild?
      They gesture towards the formation of the land, a shape out on the horizon. On their datapad, following a list of struck-out coordinates, is a single word in legible script: Dun's'kaareen. <MOOD>Sad<>They shake their head sadly.
    war_scavenger_opt_a_8: Encourage them
    war_scavenger_opt_b_8: Console them

      deep for a stranger to console."
    war_scavenger_res_c_8: I indicate that it is not my place to interfere with %NAME%'s
      journey. They nod appreciatively, as though something has just been confirmed
      to them, and hand me something small for my own journey.
    dnt_war_ext_scavenger_lang_1: Grah! Surprise! Interloper came quietly! No fear?
    war_ext_scavenger_desc_1: The warrior's shout seems more surprised than aggressive.
      They poke at me in disbelief. Their own skin leathery and thickened, they seem
      shocked that a lifeform such as I can survive out here.
    war_ext_scavenger_opt_a_1: Ask why they are out here
    war_ext_scavenger_res_a_1: "%NAME% chuckles. They seem impressed that I have toughed
      it all the way out here. They pass me a glowing crystal, indicating that they
      have gathered many more, and I should keep this one."
    war_npc_hot_desc_2: |-
      A deep sigh escapes this Vy'keen. They are hunched over a datapad, gazing at footage of another of their species. The figure in the video looks very similar to themselves, and stands within a field of living rocks.
      Noticing me, the Vy'keen grunts. With some reluctance, they point to the rocks in the hologram, then to the scorched landscape outside. I gather that they are <STELLAR>asking for my assistance<>...
    dnt_war_npc_hot_lang_2: Honourable father had farm, proud farm. I am not worthy,
      too weak to fight the heat. Such shame...
    war_npc_hot_opt_a_2: Offer botanical assistance
    war_npc_hot_opt_b_2: Leave
    war_npc_hot_res_a_2: The warrior locks eyes with me. They nod stoically, accepting
      my offer of assistance. Sensing their need for privacy, I leave them be.
    war_npc_hot_res_b_2: The Vy'keen sinks even further into themselves, and turns
      away from me.
    war_npc_hot_farm_ret: "%NAME% faces me proudly, all trace of their prior melancholy
      wiped away. They look at me expectantly."
    war_npc_hot_farm_ret_opt_a: Give samples
    war_npc_hot_farm_ret_res_a: |-
      The Vy'keen feeds the samples into a specialized processor, their movements tightly controlled. Within seconds, the Solanium bulbs are peeled and raw, ideal for replanting.
      Something flickers in their expression. They look towards me, but at a fixed distance, not quite meeting my eyes.
    war_npc_hot_farm_ret2_opt_a: Offer planting assistance
    war_npc_hot_farm_ret2_opt_b: Silently take bulbs
    war_npc_hot_farm_ret2_res_a: "%NAME%'s expression wavers again, as though they

      turn away."
    war_npc_hot_farm_ret2_res_b: "%NAME% visibly relaxes as I silently anticipate
      their request. They involve themselves in something on their datapad, effectively
      dismissing me."
    war_npc_hot_desc_3: With surprising deftness, this Vy'keen is working to reconfigure
      their Multi-Tool's weapon attachments. The tool's eccentric appearance suggests
      this is not its first custom modification.
    dnt_war_npc_hot_lang_3: Heat bad for Vy'keen, but military efficiency of sentinel
      enemies not affected by hazard! I help Multi-Tool to create incinerating death.
      But no success yet. Grah!
    war_npc_hot_opt_a_3: Examine Multi-Tool
    war_npc_hot_opt_b_3: Touch Multi-Tool
    war_npc_hot_res_a_3: The Vy'keen seems to be attempting to fortify their attacks
      with extra heat, but with limited success. Sentinel drone casings bearing varying
      degrees of charring litter the floor.
    war_npc_hot_res_b_3: My Exosuit flashes an alarm as it comes into contact with
      the Vy'keen's Multi-Tool. The barrel is scorchingly hot to the touch. %NAME%
      bares their teeth, unimpressed with my interference.
    war_npc_hot_ret_opt_a_3: Suggest maximum heat
    war_npc_hot_ret_opt_b_3: Suggest hazard protection upgrade
    war_npc_hot_ret_opt_c_3: Shoot casing
    war_npc_hot_ret_res_a_3: |-
      The Vy'keen approves of my aggressive suggestion, and makes a dramatic adjustment to their weapon's heat mod. They eagerly fire another practice shot - and the weapon's barrel promptly melts.
      <MOOD>VeryNegative<>With a roar of despair, they rip their Multi-Tool apart, the experimental modifications flying about the facility. Some of the debris hits me as it scatters.
    war_npc_hot_ret_res_b_3: |-
      As I suggest a more defensive tactic, the Vy'keen's expression transitions from thoughtful to frenzied inspiration. Laughing maniacally, they tear something loose from their Multi-Tool and reattach it to their Exosuit. The suit itself begins to emit flames.
      Delighted with their new flame shield, the warrior thanks me with a gift.
    war_npc_hot_ret_res_c_3: Lacking the alien vocabulary to reason with the Vy'keen,
      I simply shoot the sentinel casing with a more effective weapon. The metal shell
      is shredded in the blast. The warrior is staggered by my wisdom, and thanks
      me generously.
    war_npc_hot_desc_4: The Vy'keen stares unblinkingly, oblivious to my presence.
      Their muscular body sways rhythmically to some internal beat. An object in their
      hands glows hot, apparently the material focus of their trance.
    war_npc_hot_opt_a_4: Examine glowing object
    war_npc_hot_opt_b_4: Take object
    war_npc_hot_opt_c_4: Wake Vy'keen
    war_npc_hot_res_a_4: |-
      The drone-shaped effigy is carved from a greyish stone, marbled with streaks of orange. In the space where the Sentinel's crimson eye would be, the orange veins glow especially bright.
      The warrior becomes aware of my proximity, stirring from their trance. They watch me suspiciously.
    war_npc_hot_res_b_4: Immediately disturbed from their trance, the warrior fixes
      me with a fierce glare. They pull the effigy closer to themselves, its bright
      luminance dimming to a gentle glow.
    war_npc_hot_ret_opt_a_4: Join trance

      dismisses me. They wish to return to their ritual."
    war_npc_hot_desc_5: The Vy'keen examines me, intensely. Their hungry gaze seems
      to peel back the protection of my Exosuit, as though considering the possible
      flavor of the flesh within. They look weakened, and desperate...

      This wild-eyed Vy'keen regards me with great suspicion as I approach. I notice that their hands are grimy and damp with sleet. <MOOD>Neutral<>After a moment of deliberation, they seem to decide they can trust me.
      I am shown a crude schematic of tightly-arranged native flora, flanked by several crossed-out sentinel drones. I am not sure I understand the full meaning, but the Vy'keen nods vigorously. I gather that they are <STELLAR>asking for my assistance<>...

      repair work. It is as though our conversation never happened.
    war_npc_cold_desc_4: The Vy'keen seems distracted, struggling to meet my eyes.
      Their Exosuit appears pristine, no visible breach in the nano-fibres, but their
      groans suggest a hidden injury. I notice blood mixed with the snow on their
      boots.

      hot in their eyes, nodding in passionate agreement. They give their old Multi-Tool
      one final reverent look, as though to say goodbye, then offer it to me.
    war_npc_cold_ret_res_b_4: The Vy'keen looks at me with respect, nodding slowly,
      absorbing the wisdom of my suggestion. They offer me a gift as thanks, then,
      with time on their hands, begin to draw up a new battle strategy.
    war_npc_cold_ret_res_c_4: The atmosphere is suddenly tense, the facility colder
      than before. The Vy'keen glares at me, their expression growing increasingly
      hateful. I leave before the situation escalates.
    war_npc_cold_desc_5: The brawny Vy'keen pauses in their work. They appear to have
      been iterating upon a medical simulation, tweaking parameters and reviewing.

      Amused by my ignorance, %NAME% shows me a close-up video of a Vy'keen eye. As the lighting in the video shifts, the eye's large central pupil divides into sixteen tiny pupils, each dilating and contracting in sync.
      It is unclear whether this is a naturally evolved trait or the result of bioengineering. Both possibilities seem equally disturbing.
    war_npc_cold_ret_res_b_5: |-
      The lifeform takes a cursory look at my eyes, then chuckles. This procedure is only suitable for Vy'keen. The optic structure of any lesser species would reject the implant.

      This Vy'keen has the sharp eyes of an officer of their species. They are reviewing a battle plan, which they openly share with me. Unambiguously illustrated at the center of the plan is a plant-based diversion.
      The Vy'keen seems convinced that increasing the local flora in one area will distract sentinel patrols from resource harvesting in another area. The warrior looks at me, clearly <STELLAR>asking for my assistance<>...

      The Vy'keen thanks me, but still seems troubled.
      Seizing this chance to unburden themselves, they share battle logs of this planet's ongoing war. Over time, a stalemate has emerged. The sentinel forces seem infinitely renewable. The Vy'keen just cannot get ahead.
      If this plan succeeds, if growing these new resources satisfies the sentinel's obsession with balance, what then? Will the Vy'keen forces be forever committed to exchanging new resources for old?

      %NAME% reels back in pain, seeming impressed. I have earned their respect.
    war_npc_lush_reta_res_b_3: The warrior's mood grows cold. Their opinion of me
      has suffered.
    war_npc_lush_res_b_3: The warrior shows me the upgrades enhancing their equipment.
      Their suit appears to be in exceptionally good repair, considering its occupant's

    war_npc_rad_res_a_2: "%NAME% barks at me. I must locate a naturally-occurring
      patch of Gamma Weed, and harvest a supply of root. Follow-up commands will be
      issued upon my return."
    war_npc_rad_res_b_2: "%NAME% is stunned into speechlessness when I do not immediately
      sign up to help. They indicate they will wait here while I come to my senses."
    war_npc_rad_farm_ret: When I return, %NAME% is hand-packing what appears to be
      ammunition shells. They greet me with practiced formality.
    war_npc_rad_farm_ret_opt_a: Give samples
    war_npc_rad_farm_ret_res_a: |-
      The Vy'keen reviews the samples I have collected, and seems to find them acceptable. A specialized device slices off the blossoms and pushes out the seeds. These, they hand to me.
      The radioactive roots are added to a collection, all at varying stages of dryness. I notice that the completely desiccated roots are what %NAME% is powdering and packing into shells.
    war_npc_rad_farm_ret2_opt_a: Ask about shells
    war_npc_rad_farm_ret2_opt_b: Request follow-up orders
    war_npc_rad_farm_ret2_res_a: |-
      %NAME% gives me a long, hard look.
      They eventually shake their head. They cannot share this technology. However, perhaps sensing tension in the question, they assure me that no sentient lifeforms will come to harm from these shells.
      They gesture outside. I should plant these seeds in a suitable location to establish a farm. When I return, they will compensate me for my service.
    war_npc_rad_farm_ret2_res_b: "%NAME% gestures outside. I should plant these seeds
      in a suitable location to establish a farm. When I return, they will compensate
      me for my service."
    war_npc_rad_desc_3: This Vy'keen is pale and clammy; something is not right. Their
      eyes, squinting with effort, seem to follow the movement of some threat in the
      air between us, but I see nothing there.
    dnt_war_npc_rad_lang_3: Drones swarm... get away, weak interloper!
    war_npc_rad_opt_a_3: Touch the air
    war_npc_rad_opt_b_3: Aim Multi-Tool at air
    war_npc_rad_opt_c_3: Snap them out of it
    war_npc_rad_res_a_3: |-
      I stretch towards the space %NAME% is watching so warily. Unsurprisingly, my hand passes through thin air.
      In a panic, as though to protect me, they grab my wrist and pull it down. Whatever they believe they see, they are convinced of its danger.
    war_npc_rad_res_b_3: I unholster my Multi-Tool and attempt to aim directly at
      the spot %NAME% is watching. They seem relieved to see the invisible threat
      addressed - then reel backwards, blinking rapidly.
    war_npc_rad_res_c_3: |-
      I shake %NAME% by the shoulders, trying to rattle the delusion from them.
      There is a resounding smack as the Vy'keen's fist collides with my chest. This disorientation doesn't seem to have dulled their aggression, or their strength.
    war_npc_rad_ret_3: |-
      The Vy'keen looks increasingly ill. A fresh wave of nausea threatens to overtake them, but their suit intervenes, allowing them to regain some composure.
      Their overloaded hazard protection flashes a desperate red. The local radiation has extended it to the verge of failure. %NAME% will not last much longer in this state.
    war_npc_rad_ret_opt_a_3: Boost hazard protection
    war_npc_rad_ret_opt_b_3: Alert their commanding officer
    war_npc_rad_ret_opt_c_3: Snap them out of it
    war_npc_rad_ret_res_a_3: |-
      The Vy'keen's suit devours the resources gratefully, %NAME% themselves looking immediately rejuvenated. For a strange moment - so brief it could be illusion - a sympathetic echo seems to course through my own exosuit.
      %NAME%'s breathing slows as the pain recedes. They remember themselves. Evidently, I have just saved a very wealthy warrior from certain death. They reward me generously, assuring me this will not be forgotten.
    war_npc_rad_ret_res_b_3: |-
      Recognizing this as an emergency, I contact Vy'keen High Command, reporting %NAME%'s state to their battalion leader.
      There is muttering and grunting on the transmission as the Vy'keen authorities confer. Finally, they thank me with a substantial payment, but urge me to avoid further contact with %NAME%.
    war_npc_rad_ret_res_c_3: I attempt to shout some sense into %NAME%, but it is
      no use. They rage feebly, mumbling something about sentinels, and urge me to
      take my shouting elsewhere.
    war_npc_shop_desc_1: The Vy'keen is lazily crushing the bones of some unfortunate
      ex-creature between their fingertips, watching the dust spill to the floor.
      They look bored.
    dnt_war_npc_shop_lang_1: Trading facility is boring! Nothing here for warrior!
      Nearly sleeping...
    war_npc_shop_opt_a_1: Ask about boredom
    war_npc_shop_opt_b_1: Ask about bones
    war_npc_shop_res_a_1: |-
      %NAME% taps their empty holster. They're stuck waiting for their Multi-Tool to be repaired, and evidently find this shop unbearably dull.
      Sighing, they gesture towards my exosuit, inquiring after its logs. They seem to be requesting entertainment. Anything to relieve their boredom.
    war_npc_shop_res_b_1: |-
      %NAME% shrugs. They're just passing the time. The previous owner of these bones is feeling no pain now.
      Sighing, they gesture towards my exosuit, inquiring after its logs. They seem to be requesting entertainment. Anything to relieve their boredom.
    war_npc_shop_ret_opt_a_1: Share exploration data
    war_npc_shop_ret_opt_b_1: Share combat data
    war_npc_shop_ret_opt_c_1: Share trade data
    war_npc_shop_ret_res_a_1: |-
      I access the data from some of the stranger planets I've visited, sharing records of gravity-defying rock formations, tragically-evolved creatures, gloriously weird flora.
      The Vy'keen perks up, impressed by the scope of my travels. Sensing a fellow adventurer, they share coordinates for a local location they intend to explore themselves, once their Multi-Tool is ready.
    war_npc_shop_ret_res_b_1: |-
      %NAME% practically salivates as we review my Exosuit logs. Their eyes glaze as they relive the glory of their own past victories, their hand subtly twitching.
      The Vy'keen's expression floods with respect, their expectations exceeded. They shape their hands into two distinct gestures: a tightly clenched fist, and a serenely upturned palm. They seem to be awaiting a choice...
    war_npc_shop_ret_res_c_1: As I begin to access the logs of my trading exploits,
      I notice %NAME% seems to have dozed off. I have quite literally bored them to
      sleep.
    war_npc_shop_ret2_opt_a_1: Choose fist
    war_npc_shop_ret2_opt_b_1: Choose palm
    war_npc_shop_ret2_res_a_1: "%NAME% nods, clenching their fist tighter still, an
      unmistakable symbol of strength. They hand me a small gift before I leave."
    war_npc_shop_ret2_res_b_1: "%NAME% nods, the fire in their eyes tempered by long-practiced
      discipline. They hand me a small gift before I leave."
    war_npc_shop_desc_2: |-
      Ostensibly, this Vy'keen is examining the facility's wares, but they seem to browse without purpose, fiddling with this and that.
      They occasionally glance towards the sales counter, seeming to compare the merchant's brawn to their own. The glances cease when I approach.
    dnt_war_npc_shop_lang_2: Pitiful work here. Vy'keen acts like Gek, exchange equipment
      for units, never join battle. Body is pathetic!
    war_npc_shop_opt_a_2: Admire their physique
    war_npc_shop_opt_b_2: Admire their Multi-Tool
    war_npc_shop_opt_c_2: Remain silent
    war_npc_shop_res_a_2: |-
      Emboldened, %NAME% throws an openly snide look towards the facility's merchant. Very obviously, in a peculiar display of dominance, they transfer units to me.
      The merchant, who already seems dissatisfied with their rank, slouches behind the counter, seething. It seems clear that their day has been made just a little bit worse.
    war_npc_shop_res_b_2: |-
      %NAME% is disconcerted when I draw attention to their upgraded, well-maintained, obviously recently purchased Multi-Tool. Even a race of warriors has need of merchants, it would appear.
      The Vy'keen shoves the Multi-Tool towards me, seeming to want it out of their sight.
    war_npc_shop_res_c_2: "%NAME% glares, seemingly resentful of an accusation I did
      not make."
    war_npc_shop_desc_3: 'The Vy''keen is pretending to read, but it is a weak attempt
      at subtlety: they are peering over the top of their datapad, examining my equipment
      upgrades.'
    dnt_war_npc_shop_lang_3: Vy'keen strength comes from Multi-Tool tradition! Trade
      important for weapon strength! Brother is foolish.
    war_npc_shop_desc_3a: Abandoning the pretence, they address me directly, sharing
      two images of Vy'keen warriors. One is armed with an advanced Multi-Tool; the
      other with a simple dagger. They watch to see which impresses me more.
    war_npc_shop_opt_a_3: Indicate the Multi-Tool
    war_npc_shop_opt_b_3: Indicate the dagger
    war_npc_shop_res_a_3: |-
      %NAME% holds themselves up a little taller. They proudly reveal a hologram of their own Multi-Tool design, customised with cutting-edge upgrades.
      Pleased to share their passion for technology, the warrior points to the modules of their weapon that could be further upgraded. They are apparently seeking my opinion.
    war_npc_shop_res_b_3: "%NAME% barks aggressively, tapping at the warrior bearing
      the Multi-Tool, but avoiding eye contact as they do. I seem to have touched
      upon some deep fear. They refuse to discuss this issue further."
    war_npc_shop_ret_opt_a_3: Suggest boltcaster upgrade
    war_npc_shop_ret_opt_b_3: Suggest analysis visor upgrade
    war_npc_shop_ret_opt_c_3: Suggest pulse spitter upgrade
    war_npc_shop_ret_res_a_3: The Vy'keen hastens to agree with this pragmatic choice.
      They tear off an old upgrade, suddenly embarrassed by it, and push the discarded
      tech in my direction.
    war_npc_shop_ret_res_b_3: The Vy'keen snorts, unimpressed. They have no interest
      in wasting weapon slots on data-gathering attachments. They wave me away.
    war_npc_outpost_desc_1: |-
      Though it doesn't show in their complexion or posture, this is a very old Vy'keen. Wisdom accrued from a lifetime of interstellar warfare burns bright in their eyes.
      The elder seems disapproving of the crowd here, glaring uneasily at the other Vy'keens. Whatever society they were once accustomed to, this motley gathering of warriors does not reflect it.
    dnt_war_npc_outpost_lang_1: Pathetic warriors here. This is not Vy'keen tradition,
      this is tragedy. We have been conquered by machines. It must end.
    war_npc_outpost_opt_a_1: Sympathise
    war_npc_outpost_opt_b_1: Ask why they're here
    war_npc_outpost_res_a_1: |-
      %NAME% cringes. Whatever their concerns with modern Vy'keen society, the input of an outsider is of no significance. I could not possibly understand.
      However, capitalizing on a sympathetic ear, the Vy'keen raises a more specific complaint. They indicate the time, and grunt with impatience. They are awaiting a delivery in this awful place. How slowly the hours pass...
    war_npc_outpost_res_b_1: |-
      They produce a hologram of a heavily modified Multi-Tool, built to maximise armour piercing capability. It is an expensive, deluxe bit of anti-Sentinel technology, customised specifically for %NAME%'s grip.
      They indicate the time, and grunt with impatience. They would be gone from here, if not still awaiting the delivery of their new weapon. How slowly the hours pass...
    war_npc_outpost_ret_opt_a_1: Offer mordite
    war_npc_outpost_ret_opt_b_1: Offer hug
    war_npc_outpost_ret_opt_c_1: Ask for a story
    war_npc_outpost_ret_res_a_1: |-
      The Vy'keen chuckles, as though the sight of the morbid compound evokes some sentimental memory for them. They pop a handful of crystals into their mouth and begin to chew.
      The resultant crunching - like shattering molars - is enough to send a shudder down my spine, but the diversion pleases the elderly Vy'keen. Apparently moved by my kindness, they offer a small gift in return.
    war_npc_outpost_ret_res_b_1: "%NAME% looks positively horrified, backing away
      the unwanted contact. Their opinion of the ramshackle crowd around us seems
      to suddenly improve, by contrast."
    war_npc_outpost_ret_res_c_1: |-
      %NAME% pats their weapon, looking misty-eyed. We lack the common tongue for complex dialogue, but - happy to share - they deliver their story via a methodical sequence of grunts, gestures and holograms. It is slow, but surprisingly engaging.
      They describe what must be centuries of war against the Sentinels. Countless comrades have fallen, but while each unique Vy'keen life is irreplaceable, the machines seem infinite. Unaffected by individual losses.
      Now in their twilight years, %NAME% is seizing their final chance to find and destroy the source of the Sentinel force. They are only machines, and must be assembled somewhere. They must be.
      The elderly Vy'keen sighs. Their gruffness softens as they re-evaluate the Vy'keen crowd around us, each life precious. They thank me for listening, and give me something to further my own journey.
    war_npc_obs_desc_1: A number of holographic star charts, distributed across multiple
      devices, is spread before this Vy'keen. Placed in reverent position nearby is
      a crumbling manuscript, which they seem to be comparing against this celestial
      data.
    dnt_war_npc_obs_lang_1: Interloper! Worthy to give advice on holy Vy'keen journey?
      I seek the way to our homeworld, with aid from the stars. Where to look now?
    war_npc_obs_opt_a_1: Shield constellation
    war_npc_obs_opt_b_1: Atlas constellation
    war_npc_obs_opt_c_1: Blob constellation
    war_npc_obs_res_a_1: The Vy'keen nods, as though they expected this response.
      They clap me on the shoulder appreciatively, and offer units for my time.
    war_npc_obs_res_b_1: The color drains from the Vy'keen's face as they consider
      the gravity of my choice. They honor me with a gift of their people, then insist
      that I leave.
    war_npc_obs_res_c_1: The Vy'keen seems offended by the irreverence of my choice.
      They growl and shove me away.
    war_npc_obs_desc_2: |-
      The Vy'keen silences me with a raised hand as I approach, as though listening to a sound - but I hear nothing. They input something into a terminal, and an eerie static drone begins to sound from within my Exosuit. We lock eyes, listening together.
      This facility seems to have been designed - or repurposed - to trace this specific audio signal. It hisses and pops, not quite coming through clearly.
    dnt_war_npc_obs_lang_2: Interloper! Join me in this noble task. I listen for the
      death of the great Hirk. Equipment coordinate is certain, but sound is still
      weak...
    war_npc_obs_opt_a_2: Calibrate volume
    war_npc_obs_opt_b_2: Calibrate pitch
    war_npc_obs_opt_c_2: Calibrate coordinates
    war_npc_obs_res_a_2: I increase the sensitivity of the receiver, but the audio
      clarity remains poor, the crackles rising in volume alongside the targeted sound.
      However, the Vy'keen seems pleased with this outcome, gifting me units in thanks.
    war_npc_obs_res_b_2: |-
      Compelled by a strange intuition, I calibrate the device's input to tune into the lower frequencies, filtering out the high-pitched crackles.
      The unmistakable echo of a warrior's roar echoes through me, clear as glass. The Vy'keen looks at me with pure wonder, listening on their own equipment. I sense that this is something utterly unique we are sharing. They salute me as I leave, and offer a reverent gift.
    war_npc_obs_res_c_2: I attempt to recalibrate the direction of the audio receiver,
      but each adjustment I make only seems to weaken the signal. The Vy'keen shouts
      at me in frustration, indicating that I should leave.
    war_npc_freighter_desc_1: The Vy'keen crewmember looks me over with thinly-veiled
      contempt. They sense that I am not a born freighter-dweller like themselves,
      and are suspicious of my soft planetary background.
    war_npc_freighter_desc_2: This Vy'keen regards their freighter mates with an expression
      of unconditional affection and loyalty. The crewmembers' features are too diverse
      for them to be related biologically, but perhaps this family has treated %NAME%
      better than their own blood.
    war_npc_freighter_desc_3: "%NAME% seems to revel in the diversity of freighter
      living. They shift restlessly while the vessel is stationary, fingering their
      Multi-Tool, anticipating the next warp to a new system."
    war_npc_freighter_desc_4: "%NAME% seems discomfited by their surroundings, as
      though not entirely at ease with freighter living. Their eyes frequently drift
      over to a fellow crewmate - an especially virile and imposing Vy'keen. I can
      only guess at what their relationship might be."
    war_npc_freighter_desc_5: The bulky Vy'keen flexes slightly as I draw near them,
      their eyes searching mine for a reaction. They seem young, and eager to prove
      themselves amongst this crew.
