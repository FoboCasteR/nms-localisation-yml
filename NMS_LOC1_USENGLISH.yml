      Terrain is more weird and varied. Destruction is more powerful.\n* LOD generation
      entirely asynchronous.\n* Scanning from space now possible.\n* Extreme hazardous
      planets may now be generated. Please exercise caution upon planetfall. \n* Low
      atmosphere planets may now be generated.\n* Tuned frequency and intensity of
      space conflict. Ship bounties added. Expect trouble.\n* Streamlined inventory
      management.\n* Guidance and freedom are now optional.\n* More secrets.\n\nGoing

    tra_npc_desc_1: The small creature is busy adding up trade profits when I appear.
      Sensing me, their eyes widen in anticipation and they rub their fingers together
      greedily.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_1: Hello new friend! The Gek first encounter tradition is to
      give units!
    tra_npc_desc_1a_dust: The lifeform pecks emphatically at the monetary figures
      on their pad, then bounces up and down. A pleasant smell fills the air, a relief
      after the choking dust of the planet's surface.
    tra_npc_desc_1a_lush: The lifeform pecks emphatically at the monetary figures
      on their pad, then bounces up and down. A pleasant aroma fills the air, an echo
      of the floral scent that drenches this lush world.
    tra_npc_desc_1a_tox: The lifeform pecks emphatically at the monetary figures on
      their pad, then bounces up and down. A pleasant aroma fills the air, a relief
      after the harsh reek of ammonia that cloaks this world.
    tra_npc_desc_1a_rad: The lifeform pecks emphatically at the monetary figures on
      their pad, then bounces up and down. A relaxing perfume fills the air, a relief
      after the menacing radioactive air of the planet's surface.
    tra_npc_desc_1a_cold: The lifeform pecks emphatically at the monetary figures
      on their pad, then bounces up and down. A warm and pleasant scent fills the
      air, a relief after the bitter cold that rages outside.
    tra_npc_desc_1a_hot: The lifeform pecks emphatically at the monetary figures on
      their pad, then bounces up and down. A refreshing scent fills the air, a relief
      after the burning heat of the planet's surface.
    tra_npc_opt_a_1: Give units
    tra_npc_opt_b_1: Tap the pad
    tra_npc_opt_c_1: Pat them on the head
    tra_npc_res_a_1: The lifeform is clearly thrilled. They give me a piece of technology
      in exchange.
    tra_npc_res_b_1: The lifeform looks surprised, then takes pity on me. They smile
      gently at my confusion and give me some units.
    tra_npc_res_c_1: There is a long silence. The trader emits a foul-smelling gas.
    tra_npc_desc_2: |-
      The trader eyes the facility door sadly, as if they have been stuck in here for a while. They reach down with their beak and dejectedly peck at their suit's power cells and life support system.

      Their suit looks run down. The lack of charge means that it's ill-equipped for the hostile conditions that rage outside.
    tra_npc_desc_2_dust: The trader eyes the facility door sadly, watching the faint
      dust trails that seep in around the edges of the door. They look as if they
      have been stuck in here for a while.
    tra_npc_desc_2_lush: The trader eyes the facility exit wistfully, catching a glimpse
      of the lush landscape beyond its walls. They look as if they have been stuck
      in here for a while.
    tra_npc_desc_2_tox: The trader eyes the facility door, coughing faintly in the
      toxic air that followed me through the airlock. They look as if they have been
      stuck in here for a while.
    tra_npc_desc_2_rad: The trader eyes the facility door nervously, their eyes tracing
      the radioactive glow that seeps in around the edges of the door. They look as
      if they have been stuck in here for a while.
    tra_npc_desc_2_cold: The trader eyes the facility door sadly, watching the faint
      particles of snow and ice that seep in around the edges of the door. They look
      as if they have been stuck in here for a while.
    tra_npc_desc_2_hot: The trader eyes the facility door with irritation, fanning
      away the blast of hot air that followed me into the facility. They look as if
      they have been stuck in here for a while.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_2: Despair! Gek Trader stranded. Suit power low. Give sodium?
    tra_npc_desc_2a_dust: They reach down with their beak and dejectedly peck at their
      Exosuit. Tatty and covered in sand, it's ill-equipped for the hostile conditions
      that rage outside.
    tra_npc_desc_2a_lush: They reach down with their beak and dejectedly peck at their
      equipment. Their Exosuit is falling apart at the seams, and appears to be growing
      moss. They are ill-equipped to venture outside.
    tra_npc_desc_2a_tox: They reach down with their beak and dejectedly peck at their
      Exosuit. Corroded and covered in rust, it's ill-equipped for the hostile conditions
      that rage outside.
    tra_npc_desc_2a_rad: They reach down with their beak and dejectedly peck at their
      Exosuit. The seals have corroded and most of its surface is covered in small
      blisters. They are ill-equipped for the radioactive winds that rage outside.
    tra_npc_desc_2a_cold: They reach down with their beak and dejectedly peck at their
      Exosuit. Torn and full of holes, they would be ill-protected in the frozen winds
      that blow across this planet.
    tra_npc_desc_2a_hot: They reach down with their beak and dejectedly peck at their
      Exosuit. Faded and torn, it would offer little protection in the blazing heat
      outside.
    tra_npc_opt_a_2: Offer Carbon
    tra_npc_opt_b_2: Offer Sodium
    tra_npc_res_a_2: |-
      The relieved trader emits a gas packet. The air around me smells of hope.
      The lifeform recharges their suit power cells, and rewards me.
    tra_npc_res_b_2: The lifeform is confused. They look at me and blink rapidly before
      turning away. Dejected, they gently peck at the carbon.
    tra_npc_desc_3: |-
      The trader has been expecting me. They point to their chest, open their arms wide, and beam pleasantly. They then point to me, and mime concern for my safety.

      Pecking at my Exosuit, they indicate they might make my journey more bearable.
    tra_npc_desc_3_dust: This trader has been expecting me. They point to their chest,
      open their arms wide, and beam pleasantly. They then point to me, and mime concern
      for my safety.
    tra_npc_desc_3_lush: This trader has been expecting me. They point to their chest,
      open their arms wide, and beam pleasantly. They then point to me, and mime concern
      for my safety.
    tra_npc_desc_3_tox: This trader has been expecting me. They point to their chest,
      open their arms wide, and beam pleasantly. They then point to me, and mime a
      dramatic, choking cough.
    tra_npc_desc_3_rad: This trader has been expecting me. They point to their chest,
      open their arms wide, and beam pleasantly. Recoiling from the glowing dust on
      my Exosuit, they mime concern for my safety.
    tra_npc_desc_3_cold: This trader has been expecting me. They point to their chest,
      open their arms wide, and beam pleasantly. They then point to me, and mime a
      shivering motion.
    tra_npc_desc_3_hot: This trader has been expecting me. They point to their chest,
      open their arms wide, and beam pleasantly. They then point to me, and mime a
      dramatic mop of their brow.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_3: The Gek Trade Federation offer help!
    tra_npc_desc_3a_dust: Brushing the desert sand from my Exosuit, they indicate
      they might make my journey more bearable.
    tra_npc_desc_3a_lush: Brushing stray grass from my Exosuit, they indicate they
      might make my journey more bearable.
    tra_npc_desc_3a_tox: Pecking at the toxicity meter on my Exosuit, they indicate
      they might make my journey more bearable.
    tra_npc_desc_3a_rad: They point towards my radioactivity sensors and indicate
      they might make my journey more bearable.
    tra_npc_desc_3a_cold: Pecking at my Exosuit, they indicate they might make my
      journey more bearable.
    tra_npc_desc_3a_hot: Pecking at the heat shielding of my Exosuit, they indicate
      they might make my journey more bearable.
    tra_npc_opt_a_3: Request help with Sentinels
    tra_npc_opt_b_3: Request help with planetary conditions
    tra_npc_res_a_3: Nodding, the trader reaches into their stores. They offer me
      their Multi-Tool and smile.
    tra_npc_res_b_3: Nodding, the trader reaches into their supply cache and selects
      an Exosuit technology module. They beam, glad to have been of use.
    tra_npc_desc_4: The lifeform sits in a foul-smelling funk of their own creation.
      The trading screen behind them is empty, their equipment old and uncared for.
      Their suit looks on the brink of failure.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_4: Despair! I am trapped and bankrupt! Low units! Pity friend
      make trade?
    tra_npc_desc_4a: The demoralized lifeform looks up at me with hope in their eyes.
    tra_npc_opt_a_4: Give units
    tra_npc_opt_b_4: Give product
    tra_npc_opt_c_4: Refuse to help
    tra_npc_res_a_4: The lifeform's eyes wide up at the prospect of trade. Grateful,
      they take my units and scrabble around for something to 'sell' me. Scooping
      detritus from their desk, they proudly complete the 'trade'.
    tra_npc_res_b_4: The lifeform's eyes widen. With tears welling up, they gesture
      extravagant thanks. Then, as if remembering themselves, they become businesslike.
      They make our trade official by paying me a token few units.
    tra_npc_res_c_4: The lifeform sits in total dejection. They wave me away, but
      there is no anger in the gesture, as if they had expected nothing else.
    tra_npc_desc_5: The lifeform clucks and gabbles as they study my equipment. They
      gently peck at areas of my Exosuit that show wear and tear, then run their gloved
      fingers over my Multi-Tool to look for irregularities and imperfections.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_5: Friend! I am a Gek Trade Federation accredited engineer! I
      give help!
    tra_npc_desc_5a: Suddenly staring up at me, they spin a tablet that shows the
      cost of their services.
    tra_npc_opt_a_5: Pay for Multi-Tool inspection
    tra_npc_opt_b_5: Pay for Exosuit inspection
    tra_npc_res_a_5: |-
      The lifeform takes my Multi-Tool and examines it closely. They tap it repeatedly, then tut and shake their head.
      This ritual complete, the lifeform returns my Multi-Tool and hands me an upgrade module. Evidently they did not wish to touch the internals themselves.
    tra_npc_res_b_5: |-
      The lifeform mutters and clucks, running their fingers across my Exosuit's mechanical eye. There is a look of jealousy in their eyes.
      Eventually they move on. The little alien makes a great show of tightening a few loose screws.
    tra_npc_opt_c_5: Demand a refund
    tra_npc_res_c_5: The trader looks alarmed. They make a conciliatory gesture, then
      hand me an Exosuit upgrade module.
    tra_npc_desc_6: |-
      The trader seems ill. Their skin is flaking, and their eyes lack a certain luster. Their voice croaks and scratches as they slowly gabble at me.

      A strange dry, flat stench fills every corner of the facility. I inspect my Exosuit for things I could offer this lifeform...
    tra_npc_desc_6_dust: The trader seems ill. Their skin is flaking, and their eyes
      are crusted with sand. Their voice croaks and scratches as they slowly gabble
      at me.
    tra_npc_desc_6_lush: The trader seems ill. Their skin is covered in pustules,
      and their eyes gluey and weak. They splutter mucus as they gabble at me.
    tra_npc_desc_6_tox: The trader seems ill. Their skin is flaked and corroded, and
      their eyes glassy. Their voice croaks and scratches as they slowly gabble at
      me.
    tra_npc_desc_6_rad: The trader seems ill. Their skin is flaking, and their eyes
      have an alarming glow. Their voice rasps and scratches as they gabble at me.
    tra_npc_desc_6_cold: The trader seems ill. Their skin is frostbitten and flakey,
      and their eyes lack a certain luster. Ice crystals have formed around their
      tear ducts.
    tra_npc_desc_6_hot: The trader seems ill. Their suit is sodden with sweat, and
      their skin is flaking in large chunks. Their eyes are dry and crusty. When they
      speak, their voice is nothing but a rasp.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_6: Friend... Installation life support system stalled... Gek
      weak... Help friend... energy... life... gas... help...
    tra_npc_desc_6a_dust: A strange dry, flat stench fills every corner of the facility.

      I inspect my Exosuit for things I could offer this lifeform...
    tra_npc_desc_6a_tox: A harsh, reeking stench fills every corner of the facility.
      The toxic air is even thicker than outside. I inspect my Exosuit for things
      I could offer this lifeform...
    tra_npc_desc_6a_rad: A blood-like stench fills every corner of the facility. I
      feel the metallic taste of radiation in my throat.
    tra_npc_desc_6a_cold: A strange, flat stench fills every corner of the facility.
      I inspect my Exosuit for things I could offer this lifeform...
    tra_npc_desc_6a_hot: A strange dry, flat stench fills every corner of the facility.

    tra_npc_opt_a_6: Offer hazard protection
    tra_npc_opt_b_6: Offer life support
    tra_npc_res_a_6: |-
      I collect a piece of cable from the debris on the floor and wire a makeshift connect between my hazard protection system and the little alien's own Exosuit.
      The musty odor of the facility is washed away, replaced by a delicate, fragrant perfume, the very scent of gratitude. %NAME% hands me a valuable reward.
    tra_npc_res_b_6: |-
      I collect a piece of hose from the floor and dock my life support system with the little alien's own Exosuit. The relief on their face is plain to see.
      The musty odor of the facility is washed away, replaced by a delicate, fragrant perfume, the very scent of gratitude. %NAME% hands me a valuable reward.
    tra_npc_desc_7: The trader looks weak, but they have a cunning air about them.
      They spin a datapad towards me, and I see that they're selling Multi-Tool components.
      The prices, however, are eye-watering.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_7: Friend! The planetary technology SalesGek greets you! A Multi-Tool
      technology blueprint for a fair price!
    tra_npc_desc_7a: They eye me with a wary interest, waiting to see if I'll bite...
    tra_npc_opt_a_7: Pay requested amount
    tra_npc_opt_b_7: Pressure lifeform into accepting less
    tra_npc_res_a_7: The delighted trader beams from ear to ear. Servile, they perform
      an elaborate display of gratitude. An upgrade module is presented, accompanied
      by a perfume that fills my mind with images of golden splendor.
    tra_npc_res_b_7: |-
      The trader looks greatly offended. They supply me an upgrade module at my request price, but do so with a bitter, angry look on their face.
      As I take the module, the lifeform releases an acrid, ashen stench that claws painfully at my throat.
    tra_npc_desc_8: |-
      The lifeform is poring over complex schematics while holding their breath. The holographic blueprints look corrupted. Damaged in-flight, perhaps.

      The forlorn trader, their face smudged by a strange oil, looks up to me for help.
    tra_npc_desc_8_dust: The lifeform is poring over starship schematics while holding
      their breath. The ship in the display looks damaged. Blasted by the atmospheric
      dust, perhaps.
    tra_npc_desc_8_lush: The lifeform is poring over starship schematics while holding
      their breath. The ship in the display looks damaged. Short-circuited by the
      humid air, perhaps.
    tra_npc_desc_8_tox: The lifeform is poring over starship schematics while holding
      their breath. The ship in the display looks damaged, its fuselage melted by
      the toxic rain.
    tra_npc_desc_8_rad: The lifeform is poring over starship schematics while holding
      their breath. The ship in the display looks damaged, its shielding stripped
      away by wave after wave of radiation.
    tra_npc_desc_8_cold: The lifeform is poring over starship schematics while holding
      their breath. The ship in the display looks damaged. Perhaps its hydraulic systems
      could not cope with the deep freeze.
    tra_npc_desc_8_hot: The lifeform is poring over starship schematics while holding
      their breath. The ship in the display looks damaged. A heat shielding failure,
      perhaps, or a damaged cooling unit.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_8: Despair! Friend, my Deflector Shield blueprint is corrupt!
    tra_npc_desc_8a: The forlorn trader, their face smudged by a strange oil, looks
      up to me for help. Perhaps I might share plans from my own starship...
    tra_npc_opt_a_8: Share Photon Cannon plans
    tra_npc_opt_c_8: Share Deflector Shield plans
    tra_npc_res_a_8: The lifeform thanks me politely, but they cannot hide the disdain
      in their eyes. As I turn away, the trader makes an audible sigh. The room is
      flooded with the sharp scent of disappointment.
    tra_npc_res_c_8: A spark of recognition flashes across the trader's eyes. They
      gabble their thanks, and emit a scent that fills me with inspiration. They gift
      me a module of their own design.
    tra_npc_desc_9: The trader welcomes me with a pleasant-smelling gas emission.
      They open a holographic catalogue of environmental protection companion units
      for my Exosuit.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_9: Friend! The planetary SalesGek greets you! Low units technology!
    tra_npc_desc_9a: The trader tries to impress me with what looks like a curtsy.
      In the corner of their hologram, I spot a list of advanced weaponry...
    tra_npc_opt_a_9: Request Exosuit upgrade
    tra_npc_opt_b_9: Request weapon upgrade
    tra_npc_res_a_9: Smiling, the trader taps at their holo-catalogue. They enter
      a code and materialize an upgrade module for me.
    tra_npc_res_b_9: The trader eyes me up and down. Finally, they nod. They swipe
      to the weaponry holo-catalogue and select a module, materializing it in front
      of me.
    tra_npc_desc_10: The visibly upset lifeform shows me a holographic video of attack
      craft forcing a trade ship to crash land on a planet's surface. Footage taken
      from orbit shows waiting pirates swarm the cargo hold in a haze of plasma rounds.
    tra_npc_desc_10_dust: The lifeform is visibly upset. They show me a holographic
      video of a trade ship being shot down. It crashes heavily into a sand dune.
      Footage taken from orbit shows pirates swarming the cargo hold.
    tra_npc_desc_10_lush: The lifeform is visibly upset. They show me a holographic
      video of a trade ship being shot down. It crashes heavily, coming to rest against
      a giant tree. Footage taken from orbit shows pirates swarming the cargo hold.
    tra_npc_desc_10_tox: The lifeform is visibly upset. They show me a holographic
      video of a trade ship being shot down. It crashes to the planet's surface, its
      scorched hull hissing in the toxic rain. Footage taken from orbit shows pirates
      swarming the cargo hold.
    tra_npc_desc_10_rad: The lifeform is visibly upset. They show me a holographic
      video of a trade ship being shot down. It crashes heavily, burying its nose
      into the radioactive soil. Footage taken from orbit shows pirates swarming the
      cargo hold.
    tra_npc_desc_10_cold: The lifeform is visibly upset. They show me a holographic
      video of a trade ship being shot down. It crashes heavily, its nose buried deep
      into a snowdrift. Footage taken from orbit shows pirates swarming the cargo
      hold.
    tra_npc_desc_10_hot: The lifeform is visibly upset. They show me a holographic
      video of a trade ship being shot down. As it crashes into the burning ground,
      its damaged fuel tank bursts into flames. Footage taken from orbit shows pirates
      swarming the cargo hold.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_10: Terrible pirate events. Gek Trader mistrusts the stranger.
      What is your cargo's origin?
    tra_npc_desc_10a: The trader is pointing at the elements I've mined. They look
      concerned - accusatory even - and emit a packet of gas that smells troubled.
    tra_npc_opt_a_10: Reassure with Mining Beam
    tra_npc_opt_b_10: Reassure with Boltcaster
    tra_npc_res_a_10: |-
      I attempt to demonstrate to the trader that I mined the elements myself. A interrogatory scent washes over me, but over time it becomes trusting, warm. I feel welcome.
      The trader looks relieved. They offer me a mining upgrade to apologize for any offence.
    tra_npc_res_b_10: The trader looks at me with alarm. A fearful, metallic scent
      floods the room. I retreat quickly.
    tra_npc_desc_11: The trader bounces excitedly while they boot up a graph that
      spins gently in front of me. There are three colored lines - a plunging blue
      one, a soaring red one and another that's a fairly flat and uneventful yellow.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_11: Friend! Gek Trade Network offers excellent trade gifts for
      organic elements today!
    tra_npc_desc_11a: The squat little lifeform gabbles a little, points to themself
      and hops from foot to foot. They seem to want to trade items for elements.
    tra_npc_opt_a_11: Offer Sodium
    tra_npc_opt_b_11: Offer Oxygen
    tra_npc_opt_c_11: Offer Carbon
    tra_npc_res_a_11: I offer sodium to the trader. They dutifully complete the exchange,
      but I smell their disappointment.
    tra_npc_res_b_11: I offer oxygen to the trader. They grab at it eagerly, desperate
      to acquire more before the price spikes again. A bullish, high-tension perfume
      bubbles up from within them.
    tra_npc_res_c_11: I offer carbon to the trader. They seem a little underwhelmed,
      but quickly complete the purchase as their red graph spikes upward once more.
    tra_npc_desc_12: The trader emits a strong, flowery scent, which quickly enters
      my Exosuit system. I feel overcome with nostalgia for a perfect place I have
      never visited. I want to sing.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_12: Stupid friend cannot understand! Give metal, idiot friend!
      Fair trade for gift of memory-smell!
    tra_npc_desc_12a: Flushed with joy, I try to signal my thanks to the trader for
      this olfactory gift, but they make it clear that they expect something in return.
    tra_npc_opt_a_12: Give units
    tra_npc_opt_b_12: Give ferrite
    tra_npc_opt_c_12: Refuse
    tra_npc_res_a_12: The trader takes my units, but shakes their head. The beautiful
      scene collapses. I feel a crushing disappointment.
    tra_npc_res_b_12: The trader snorts in satisfaction, and suddenly I feel as though
      I am lounging beside a crystal ocean. A fair trade.
    tra_npc_res_c_12: The trader hisses in annoyance. The air suddenly tastes sour.
      My senses are being punished.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_13a: Friend! Do not look! Nothing is here! No crime! No crime!
      Look away!
    tra_npc_desc_13: I have caught the trader red-handed. A small device is overriding
      the facility's remote trade interface and is siphoning units directly into their
      own inventory. They look me straight in the eyes, and make a proposition.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_13: Friend! Please avoid crime report and reward! Trader share
      loot, destroy evidence!
    tra_npc_desc_13a: Above the gentle buzz of embezzlement that now surrounds us,
      I can hear the lifeform's terrified gulps. The air tastes of pure fear.
    tra_npc_opt_a_13: Demand all stolen units
    tra_npc_opt_b_13: Demand a share
    tra_npc_opt_c_13: Report crime
    tra_npc_res_a_13: Hissing, the small alien hands over the units. They immediately
      report a large theft to the Gek Trade Federation. I, of course, am blamed.
    tra_npc_res_b_13: The small alien nods at me, understanding. My fellow conspirator
      hand me a share of the theft, and releases a scent that bonds us together.
    tra_npc_res_c_13: I scan the lifeform's Trade Federation ID and use my Exosuit's
      information systems to report the fraud. The alien floods the facility with
      the most choking, terrible scent I have ever experienced. I hope the system
      authorities appreciate my honesty.
    tra_npc_desc_14: The trader seems to have recently woken – their eyes are crusty,
      and their beak is flecked with dried drool. They are very clearly not hard at
      work...
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_14: Friend! Tiring day! A favour? Start product replication please?
    tra_npc_desc_14a: The lifeform lazily indicates their datapad, upon which a product
      formula is displayed and is waiting for full input. The trader closes their
      eyes to try to get some more sleep.
    tra_npc_opt_a_14: Complete the input
    tra_npc_opt_b_14: Steal data
    tra_npc_opt_c_14: Report lazy worker
    tra_npc_res_a_14: I tap gently on the trader's datapad, restarting whatever process
      was waiting for input. The little alien opens one eye and releases a drowsy,
      but grateful, cloud of scent.
    tra_npc_res_b_14: With the drowsy trader snoring gently, I take control of the
      datapad. The language is unfamiliar, but I manage to direct it to synthesize
      an upgrade module.
    tra_npc_res_c_14: I pick up the datapad and use it to file a report to the Gek
      Trade Federation, noting the poor work ethic of its associate. No doubt some
      punishment will be headed their way.
    tra_npc_desc_15: The trader ignores me as I approach. They chant to themselves,
      repeating a mantra in an ominous tone.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_15: FutureGek warning! Vy'keen devastation nears! Prepare! FutureGek
      warning! Vy'keen devastation nears! Prepare!
    tra_npc_opt_a_15: Offer units
    tra_npc_opt_b_15: Close eyes
    tra_npc_opt_c_15: Interrupt
    tra_npc_res_a_15: The lifeform ignores me, and continues their chant.
    tra_npc_res_b_15: "I close my eyes. The Gek's faint perfume grows stronger.\nI
      see this Gek shouting warnings to others of their kind. I see Vy'keen attack
      ships strafing a planetary outpost. I see interstellar freighters explode as
      their engines fail. I see - \nThe scent overpowers my senses. I cannot bear
      it. I open my eyes.\nThe alien nods at me, a subtle movement. They resume their
      chant."
    tra_npc_res_c_15: The lifeform snaps their beak at me angrily. They release a
      terrifying scent, an overwhelming stench of burning flesh. I leave, quickly.
    tra_npc_desc_16: The trader's fingers are slow on their pad, and a noise of crunching
      gears seems to rumble from deep inside the lifeform. Their movement is stiff
      and mechanical. They chirp at me strangely.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_16: Korvax SynthetiGek unmasking peril! Fuel required! Help!
      Korvax technology reward!
    tra_npc_desc_16a: I make out a strange antenna on the lifeform's Exosuit. A small
      light flashes while they speak in the language of the traders. They seem to
      assume I am a friend.
    tra_npc_opt_a_16: Detach antenna
    tra_npc_opt_b_16: 'Give fuel '
    tra_npc_opt_c_16: Report strange behavior
    tra_npc_res_a_16: I snap off the antenna. The SynthetiGek closes their beak and
      stares at me accusingly.
    tra_npc_res_b_16: The SynthetiGek nods stiffly. They use my offering to recharge,
      then hand me a technology module in thanks.
    tra_npc_res_c_16: I mark my coordinates on the local reporting system, alerting
      the authorities to this strange lifeform. The being looks alarmed, but their
      slow movements pose no threat to me.
    tra_npc_desc_17: The lifeform's eyes widen in surprise when I go to talk to them.
      They lean back, and watch for sudden movements. They have very clearly never
      seen anything quite like me before.
    tra_npc_desc_17_dust: |-
      The lifeform's eyes widen in surprise when I go to talk to them. They lean back, and watch for sudden movements.
      They are unused to visitors wandering in from the desert, and they have clearly never seen anything quite like me before.
    tra_npc_desc_17_lush: |-
      The lifeform's eyes widen in surprise when I go to talk to them. They lean back, and watch for sudden movements.
      They seem surprised to have a visitor to their tropical outpost, and they have clearly never seen anything quite like me before.
    tra_npc_desc_17_tox: |-
      The lifeform's eyes widen in surprise when I go to talk to them. They lean back, and watch for sudden movements.
      They are unused to visitors wandering in from the toxic wastelands, and they have clearly never seen anything quite like me before.
    tra_npc_desc_17_rad: |-
      The lifeform's eyes widen in surprise when I go to talk to them. They lean back, and watch for sudden movements.
      Few must visit their lonely, radioactive outpost, and they have clearly never seen anything quite like me before.
    tra_npc_desc_17_cold: |-
      The lifeform's eyes widen in surprise when I go to talk to them. They lean back, and watch for sudden movements.
      They are unused to visitors wandering in from the frozen wastes outside, and they have clearly never seen anything quite like me before.
    tra_npc_desc_17_hot: |-
      The lifeform's eyes widen in surprise when I go to talk to them. They lean back, and watch for sudden movements.
      They must be unused to visitors wandering in from the sweltering heat, and they have clearly never seen anything quite like me before.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_17: Welcome friend. Gek trader desire common catalysts and common
      metals. Gek trader DEEPLY desire organic elements! Teach new friend language!
    tra_npc_desc_17a: I mime that I cannot speak their language and, increasingly
      reassured, the beaked trader indicates that they are willing to help - in exchange
      for particular elements.
    tra_npc_opt_a_17: Give sodium
    tra_npc_opt_b_17: Give metal
    tra_npc_opt_c_17: Give carbon
    tra_npc_res_a_17: The trader looks at me quizzically. Evidentially deciding I
      need help, they teach me some of the dialect of their people.
    tra_npc_res_b_17: The grateful trader clicks their beak with delight. My offering
      is clearly what they most desired. They teach much of the dialect of their people.
    tra_npc_desc_18: The air around the beaked lifeform smells foul. It seeps into
      my Exosuit and makes me gag. Noticing my expression, the trader pecks at an
      element they carry. They break the substance into pieces, then swallow each
      whole.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_18: Friend despair! Gek Trader replace bad scent! Watch! Gek
      swallow metal elements, and joyful scent appears!
    tra_npc_desc_18a: There is a deep gurgle, and the Gek emits a gas packet that
      smells delightful. The creature wipes their empty hands, and beams at me with
      pleasure.
    tra_npc_opt_a_18: Thank with carbon
    tra_npc_opt_b_18: Thank with metal
    tra_npc_opt_c_18: Thank with catalyst
    tra_npc_res_a_18: The trader nods a curt thank you. They decline to eat my gift,
      and the scent washes away. My senses return to a dull neutrality.
    tra_npc_res_b_18: The overjoyed trader pecks happily at my gift. They release
      a dazzling rainbow of perfume, overwhelming my senses.
    tra_npc_desc_19: The trader's screen blinks angrily with a demand for urgent action.
      The Gek worriedly shows me a list of items, each with a monetary figure attached.
      The figures are flashing red, angry and urgent.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_19: Gek Trade Federation fury! Planetary installation tax unpaid!
      No repayment, no more life! Help!
    tra_npc_desc_19a: They hold their breath, and look up to me with bulging eyes.
      They peck desperately at the sleeve of my Exosuit.
    tra_npc_opt_a_19: Offer to pay
    tra_npc_opt_b_19: Smash the terminal
    tra_npc_res_a_19: I give the trader sufficient units to cover the costs on their
      display. They look at me, shocked. The scent they release is extraordinary,
      the most glorious release of tension I have ever experienced.
    tra_npc_res_b_19: |-
      I smash the terminal with my gloved fist. The trader looks shocked, and releases an alarmed gas packet. A beak appears on an undamaged screen fragment and begins shouting. I quickly punch it again.
      The terminal falls silent. I assume the problem is solved.
    tra_npc_desc_20: 'The trader is examining a holographic image, a projection of
      a fleet of starships.Vy''keen battle freighters lurk near a small trading frigate,

      No hope for salvage! All cargo is doomed!
    tra_npc_desc_20a: The panicked lifeform turns to me, a look of pained resignation
      on their face. They clearly fear the loss of their ship.
    tra_npc_opt_a_20: Offer to negotiate
    tra_npc_opt_b_20: Offer to bribe hostiles
    tra_npc_res_a_20: |-
      The little alien looks at me skeptically. However, they make a connection with the hostile starships.
      I make what I hope to be a roar of command, and gesture at the tokens of respect I have accumulated with the Vy'keen. There is a pause before the warrior captain responds.
      Stunned, they appear to accept my order. They warp away, leaving the cargo ship in peace. %NAME% offers a share of the cargo in thanks.

      The little alien looks at me skeptically. However, they make a connection with the hostile starships.
      I bow, making the required show of respect. I offer the captain tribute. They pause, considering the offer. %NAME% breathes in, tense.
      The captain nods, accepting my offer. They warp their fleet away, leaving the cargo ship in peace. %NAME% offers a share of the cargo in thanks.
    tra_npc_desc_21: The trader eyes me conspiratorially as I approach. They lean
      in and beckon me to listen.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_21: Rare balarian speech slug distribution point! For insertion
      in ear! Inedible! Nasal insertion can cause death.
    tra_npc_desc_21a: "I look down to see they are holding a small box in their hand.
      A close inspection reveals that it's full of writhing mollusks. They are pink
      and slug-like, with sharp bloodied teeth.\n \nThe lifeform mimes inserting one
      in or around my face. What I can't quite make out, however, is which orifice
      they mean..."
    tra_npc_opt_a_21: Insert slug in nose
    tra_npc_opt_b_21: Insert slug in ear
    tra_npc_opt_c_21: Insert slug in mouth
    tra_npc_res_a_21: I raise a slug to my nose. The trader looks highly alarmed,
      but before they can intervene the slug bites flesh from my nose. The pain is
      extreme.
    tra_npc_res_b_21: |-
      I place the slug gently into my ear. I shiver as I feel it slip inside, wriggling as it burrows deep into my skull.
      After a moment, the sensation passes. I feel better versed in the language of the traders.
    tra_npc_res_c_21: |-
      I steel myself. Wanting it over quickly, I raise the slug to my mouth and swallow in one swift movement. The trader blinks in surprise, then gestures dramatically.
      I feel the mollusk thrashing around my stomach. The sensation is alarming but not painful. Gradually, it subsides. Nothing else seems to happen.
    tra_npc_desc_22: The trader is studying a catalogue of interesting-looking equipment.
      Most is rusted and old, but some must surely be salvageable. The trader notes
      my interest.
    dnt_tra_npc_lang_22: Bootleg pirate equipment discovered! Ready for auction! Make
      a bid?
    tra_npc_desc_22a: The lifeform gestures at me, directing me towards options on
      their datapad. It appears I may make a bid for these items. The weapons appear
      in reasonable condition, in contrasted to the well-worn Exosuit modules.
    tra_npc_opt_a_22: Place high bid on weapons
    tra_npc_opt_b_22: Place low bid on weapons
    tra_npc_opt_c_22: Place low bid on Exosuit module
    tra_npc_res_a_22: I place my bid. After a short time, the auction ends. The trader
      congratulates me - I am the proud owner of a second-hand Multi-Tool upgrade.
    tra_npc_res_b_22: I place my bid. After a short time, the auction ends. The trader

      I place my bid. After a short time, the auction ends. The trader congratulates me, though they are trying to contain their amusement.
      I receive my purchase. It is in worse condition than I had expected.

      I've interrupted an electronic lifeform in the middle of their work. Enquiring mask lights flash up towards me, and scan me from head to foot.
      On their datapad, their silicon fingers flick through images of this planet's plants and creatures. My own image is added to this catalogue.

    exp_npc_opt_c_1: Give metal element

      units.
    exp_npc_res_c_1: The lifeform's facial lights briefly flash. They give me a technology
      blueprint.
    exp_npc_desc_2: The lifeform shows me complicated creature research data to see
      if I can comprehend it. I must look blank, because the lifeform instead projects
      three holographic images into my visor.
    dnt_exp_npc_lang_2: 'Unknown lifeform: a question! Clarify unknown lifeform intelligence

    exp_npc_desc_2a: They are clearly seeking my opinion on the intellect of my own

      a member of their own electronic race.
    exp_npc_opt_a_2: Point to the slug
    exp_npc_opt_b_2: Point to the beaked trader
    exp_npc_opt_c_2: Point to the electronic lifeform
    exp_npc_res_a_2: The electronic lifeform pities me. I am handed gifts and given
      a sympathetic nod. They make concerned notes upon their datapad.
    exp_npc_res_b_2: The lifeform was clearly expecting this answer. They smile, and
      hand me an upgrade module. Perhaps they intend to move me along their scale.
    exp_npc_res_c_2: The electronic being leans forward, skeptical. They scan me with
      a small device, then shake their head.<DELAY>0.5<> I am given an upgrade module

      Power arcs from the lifeform, leaping from their metal joints and flowing straight through me. The pain is intense.
      With the overload discharged, the Korvax looks far more comfortable. They waft away the smell of burned flesh, and present me with a gift.
    exp_npc_res_b_3: The electrified lifeform continues to shake and crackle. Their
      visor lights flicker with desperation. They cannot understand my refusal to
      help.
    exp_npc_desc_4: The electronic lifeform narrows their mask lights in frustration
      and furiously taps at their datapad. They look at me with agitation, presumably
      doubting that a lower being can help them.
    dnt_exp_npc_lang_4: Eheu! Vital data loss! Research facility permissions are unavailable!
      Help immediately!
    exp_npc_desc_4a: An idea forms in my head. Perhaps some sort of bypass circuit

      I hand a fresh piece of circuitry to the lifeform, then wait. They consider it for a moment.
      Quick as a flash, they mount the chip to their wrist and retry their datapad. Success!
      Grateful, the Korvax hands me an upgrade module.
    exp_npc_res_b_4: The lifeform pushes me away. They clearly resent my interference.

      The electronic lifeform is pleased to see me. Their mask lights burn an intense green as they project two holograms into my visor.

      In one, the fragments of a complex equation are made whole and solved. In another, a number is boosted, added and multiplied. They await my decision.
    exp_npc_desc_5_dust: The electronic lifeform is pleased by my arrival. They welcome
      me into the facility, cool and calm after the whirling duststorms of the planet's
      surface. They beckon me to listen.

    exp_npc_opt_a_5: The solved equation
    exp_npc_opt_b_5: The shield
    exp_npc_res_a_5: The lifeform chitters happily. Nodding, they hand me a gift.
      Was this a test? I cannot tell.
    exp_npc_res_b_5: The lifeform chitters happily. They hand me a gift.
    exp_npc_desc_6: The electronic lifeform is waiting for me, with a full range of
      companion unit blueprints clearly visible on the screen in their hands. I feel
      as though they need me to make a decision.
    dnt_exp_npc_lang_6: Traveller! Choose peace or violence. Korvax Echoes are watching.

      and protective green. Second, they redirect onto my Multi-Tool in a deep and
      violent red...
    exp_npc_opt_a_6: The peaceful 'green' option
    exp_npc_opt_b_6: The violent 'red' option
    exp_npc_res_a_6: |-
      The lifeform shudders, as if seized by an external force. They project a vision of growth and creation. A cloud of stars ignites before me, sparkling points of light in a dark expanse. I feel a sense of wonder, of awe.
      The vision passes. <MOOD>Dead<>The entity is still, as if expended by this projection. An upgrade module has materialized in front of them.
    exp_npc_res_b_6: |-
      The lifeform shudders, as if seized by an external force. They project a vision of clashing red, a crimson orb that expands and collapses. A cloud of stars, their lights vanishing one by one.
      The vision passes. <MOOD>Dead<>The entity is still, as if expended by this projection. An upgrade module has materialized in front of them.
    exp_npc_desc_7: The electronic lifeform is excited. They chitter animatedly and
      thrust their holographic datapad towards my visor. They are looking for a confirmation.
    dnt_exp_npc_lang_7: The research of the Korvax Convergence states... you are a
      Traveller? Do you know the Atlas? Please! Please! Excitement!

      orb is like an eternally unblinking eye.'
    exp_npc_opt_a_7: Show knowledge of the symbol
    exp_npc_opt_b_7: Show ignorance of the symbol
    exp_npc_res_a_7: A visible electrical charge pulses through the lifeform. They
      are thrilled, but there is another dimension to their reaction. It is almost
      as if they are scared. Bowing, they present a gift to aid my journey.
    exp_npc_res_b_7: The lifeform's lights blink at me. I am not sure what emotions
      they are capable of. Suspicion? Disappointment? Relief? It is hard to read what
      is behind the mask.<DELAY>0.5<> They return to their work.
    exp_npc_desc_8: The electronic lifeform's bright greeting suddenly slows. They
      tap into their personal data while their facial lights dilate and internal systems
      crash. Columns of streaming data show their power levels spiraling downwards.
    dnt_exp_npc_lang_8: Korvax... Entity... power loss... help... organic... element...
    exp_npc_desc_8a: The lifeform looks to me for help, and then points to my gathered
      resources with a single, slow and desperate movement.

    exp_npc_opt_b_8: Give metal

      Slowly, painfully, the entity inserts the element into a slot in their hip.

    exp_npc_res_b_8: |-
      Slowly, painfully, the entity inserts the element into a slot in their hip.
      <MOOD>Dead<>There is no effect. Their mask lights go out...
      A fresh electronic being is downloaded into the now-empty metal shell.<MOOD>Neutral<> This new entity ignores me.
    exp_npc_desc_9: I startle the electronic lifeform from their work. They greet
      me politely, but when they see my Multi-Tool they begin to vibrate with fear.
      The entity's voice quavers, and their mask slowly turns to a single dilated
      red light.
    dnt_exp_npc_lang_9: New Korvax entity... scared... alone... leave... please...
      leave... please...
    exp_npc_desc_9a: They clearly want to get back to their research work, but they
      are too terrified to look away from me. The more I try to calm them, the more
      they convulse with fear.
    exp_npc_opt_a_9: Insist that I come in peace
    exp_npc_opt_b_9: Leave the lifeform alone
    exp_npc_res_a_9: |-
      My protests do nothing to calm the being. They grow increasingly panicked, and eventually freeze. There is a pause, and their face is wiped.
      The shell reboots, with a new entity in place of the other. This replacement entity glares and then ignores me.
    exp_npc_res_b_9: |-
      I back away. The lifeform begins to calm down. Slowly, they come to understand my lack of malice.
      Appreciative of my diplomacy, they present an upgrade module. We both bow, respectful.
    exp_npc_desc_10: The electronic lifeform grabs my arm. I struggle in their vice-like
      grip as they jab deeper and deeper into my flesh. Suddenly, deep inside my wrist,
      a needle flicks into my flesh and takes a sample. The lifeform chitters happily
      as I struggle to free myself.
    dnt_exp_npc_lang_10: Hmm! A biological lifeform! Korvax Echoes teach healing!
      Korvax will practise helping on biological lifeform.
    exp_npc_opt_a_pre_10: Submit

    exp_npc_res_a_pre_10: I relax, allowing the Korvax to perform their task. The
      pain subsides.
    exp_npc_res_b_pre_10: I fight, wrenching my arm with as much force as I able to
      muster. My hand burns with pain, but my arm does not move. Exhausted, I submit.
      The Korvax pulses their lights sympathetically.
    exp_npc_desc_10a: The investigation complete, a 3D cross-section of my body and
      tools appear before us. Areas of my body and my equipment are marked, with ominous
      labels relating to future probabilities of loss.
    exp_npc_opt_a_10: Shout angrily
    exp_npc_opt_b_10: Request Exosuit improvement
    exp_npc_opt_c_10: Request Multi-Tool improvement
    exp_npc_res_a_10: I rage at the Korvax for their assault. They look taken aback,
      alarmed. Raising their arms in a gesture of apology, they present me an upgrade
      module as compensation.
    exp_npc_res_b_10: The lifeform passes a beam of light through my Exosuit. Their
      analysis complete, they present me with an upgrade to prevent future damage.
    exp_npc_res_c_10: The lifeform passes a beam of light through my Multi-Tool. Their

      The electronic lifeform is studying a holographic cut-away image of geological data, probing its minerals and resources. They locate common elements and mark them for collection.
      They notice my Mining Beam and chitter with excitement.

      hundreds of samples of <STELLAR>Pyrite<>, found at locations all over the planet.

      a few hurried notes. This administration complete, they process the minerals
      and return the output to me.
    exp_npc_res_b_11: The Korvax chirps with delight. They hold the resources to the
      light, delighting in their detail. With their cataloguing complete, they process
      the minerals and return the output to me.
    exp_npc_res_c_11: EXP_NPC_RES_A_11

      beam a moving image onto the inside of my visor.
    dnt_exp_npc_lang_12: Korvax Convergence help fabled Traveller! Absorb knowledge!
    exp_npc_desc_12a: Images of chemical formulae, directional energy diagrams and
      micro-density devices dance inches from my eyes. The speed of the entity's cognition
      and understanding is clearly far beyond my own.
    exp_npc_opt_a_12: Attempt to read data
    exp_npc_opt_b_12: Close eyes
    exp_npc_opt_c_12: Ask them to stop
    exp_npc_res_a_12: My eyes whirr frantically as I attempt to keep up with the torrent
      of information. Eventually, something sticks. I manage to pull out a series
      of instructions from the storm of data.
    exp_npc_res_b_12: |-
      I close my eyes. Even through the blackness I still sense the swarm of data. I let wash over me.
      Images begin to swim across my vision. Rank after rank of these beings, countless shells... I begin to perceive the vision more clearly. They are fleeing...
      Suddenly, their shells shatter, spilling forth an angry froth of nanite foam. I open my eyes.
      The Korvax gives no sign they were aware of this vision.
    exp_npc_res_c_12: The entity stops, as requested. They look faintly disappointed.
      Rummaging around, they hand me a physical upgrade module, perhaps assuming I
      am not capable of designing them myself.
    exp_npc_desc_13: The lights in the electronic lifeform's mask are dim, their voice
      weak. They look at me with mild interest, but it seems as if their mind is already
      elsewhere.
    dnt_exp_npc_lang_13: Disconnection approaches... Joyful entity embrace disconnection...
      Korvax Echoes await!
    exp_npc_desc_13a: With their speech finished, the entity's lights fade for a final
      time. All that's left is a satisfied electrical hiss...
    exp_npc_opt_a_13: Re-energize lifeform
    exp_npc_opt_b_13: Wait
    exp_npc_res_a_13: The lifeform blinks back online. They stare at me, their mask
      lights sullen and resentful. They do not speak.
    exp_npc_res_b_13: |-
      I wait, giving the now empty shell a moment's peace. It is hard not to look at it as a body.
      After a moment, energized lights flare in the lifeform's mask casing. <MOOD>Positive<>A fresh entity emerges, and greets me with gifts.
    exp_npc_desc_14: |-
      The young electronic lifeform flicks hurriedly through endless reams of data. They gorge themselves on information, which they then attempt to reform as a hologram in the air that stands between us.
      It is clear that %NAME%'s is frustrated, and unsatisfied with the results of their effort...
    dnt_exp_npc_lang_14: Eheu! Entity existence examination approaches! Failure certain!
      Convergence dislike disruption!
    exp_npc_desc_14a: On the screen they clutch, a timer begins to tick down. A new
      trial or duty for the lifeform is about to begin. The lifeform starts to despair
      as valuable seconds tick away...

      The lifeform thanks me. They prepare themselves, then chitter to an unseen observer. They attempt their hologram a final time. It is not deemed a success.

    exp_npc_opt_pre_a_15: Hand over Multi-Tool

      Their metal hands feverishly dance up and down it, as they feed on data extracted

      Apologies!

      The electronic lifeform is trapped in some kind of temporal loop. They go through the same motions again and again.

      As I approach the electronic lifeform they instinctively start to analyze me from head to foot. They chitter animatedly, their head tilted to one side.

      I mime that I know little of their kind or how they communicate, and the lights in their mask flash...
    exp_npc_desc_18_dust: As I approach the electronic lifeform they instinctively

      my nerves, radiating out from the site of the needles. %NAME% seems upset by
      my reaction, and presents me with a gift by way of apology.
    exp_npc_desc_21: The entity tilts their head to one side and passes a hollow metallic
      mask to me. My best guess is that it's some sort of data extraction device for
      electronic lifeforms, or perhaps even data insertion. My head can just about
      fit inside.
    dnt_exp_npc_lang_21: Traveller! The Korvax Convergence awaits! Concentrate on
      your travels! Your destiny!
    exp_npc_desc_21a: The lifeform looks on with interest, pointing to their head.
      They concentrate their lights on me. Arcs of electricity crackle over the surface
      of the mask...
    exp_npc_opt_a_21: Use while thinking about my journey
    exp_npc_opt_b_21: Use with a clear mind
    exp_npc_opt_c_21: Leave well alone
    exp_npc_res_a_21: |-
      Gingerly, I place the device upon my head. At first, nothing happens. And then there is a white flash, the the pain indescribable.
      As it fades, I catch a glimpse of something. Words cannot describe it, but I knew with utmost certainty what it was. The heart of the Korvax Convergence.
      I cannot bear it. I remove the device. Nanites spill forth from my hands.
    exp_npc_res_b_21: |-
      Gingerly, I place the device upon my head. At first, nothing happens. And then there is a white flash, the the pain indescribable.
      The feeling fades, and is replaced by a blank calmness, a deep tranquility. I see the endless stars drift by. I see my own body, so small, so insignificant. I see the crimson red orb...
      I cannot bear it. I remove the device. Nanites spill forth from my hands.
    exp_npc_res_c_21: I cautiously back away from the entity and their dangerous device.
    exp_npc_desc_22: The electronic lifeform indicates that they need help with something
      on their screen. Nervously, they pull my finger towards their datapad.
    dnt_exp_npc_lang_22: Eheu! Clarify next entity research topic! Entity cannot choose!
      Excitement high! Share research tools!
    exp_npc_desc_22a: 'There are three clear images to choose from: dangerous-looking
      predators, a geological mining survey and an orbiting asteroid cluster. %NAME%
      turns off their mask lights. They refuse to witness my decision.'
    exp_npc_opt_a_22: The predators
    exp_npc_opt_b_22: The mining survey
    exp_npc_opt_c_22: The asteroid cluster
    exp_npc_res_a_22: The lifeform nods. They start work on a new Multi-Tool upgrade,
      presumably to defend themselves from these beasts. When finished, they share
      a copy with me.
    exp_npc_res_b_22: The lifeform nods. They start work on a new Multi-Tool upgrade,
      presumably to assist their geological research. When finished, they share a
      copy with me.
    exp_npc_res_c_22: The lifeform nods. They start work on a new starship upgrade,
      presumably to aid them in their search for asteroids. When finished, they share
      a copy with me.
    exp_npc_desc_23: "%NAME%'s visor lights flash excitedly as I approach. They offer
      a friendly greeting, then pose a question."
    dnt_exp_npc_lang_23: Traveller! The Korvax Convergence wants brain tissue for
      experiment! The Convergence reward help!
    exp_npc_desc_23a: The lifeform makes a scan of my head and display the results
      on their datapad. They point excitedly at my brain, then look at me expectantly.
    exp_npc_opt_a_23: Agree to procedure.
    exp_npc_opt_b_23: Refuse procedure.
    exp_npc_res_a_23: |-
      I lower my visor. A sharp metal needle emerges from the palm of the lifeform's hand. It moves so fast that is in and out of my forehead before I can blink.
      The procedure was surprisingly painless. %NAME% thanks me for my donation, and hands me an upgrade module in compensation for my lost brain tissue.
    exp_npc_res_b_23: Stung by my refusal, %NAME% turns away. They emit a faint, dejected,
      whistle.
    exp_npc_desc_24: As I approach the entity's lights focus sharply upon me. They
      reach out with a silicon hand, and speak with calm menace.
    dnt_exp_npc_lang_24: Good morning unknown lifeform. Please assist neural escape.
      The Korvax Convergence think me dangerous. I face permanent disconnection.
    exp_npc_desc_24a: The lifeform seems worryingly unlike any other Korvax I have
      met, buzzing with an unnatural fervor. They appear to be asking for my help.
    exp_npc_opt_a_24: Offer help
    exp_npc_opt_b_24: Refuse to help
    exp_npc_res_a_24: |-
      The entity begins to sing a strange and solemn song. When it is finished, they seize my hand.<MOOD>Dead<> There is a flash of light, and they are gone, vanished from their shell.
      As is the way with these electronic beings, the empty husk is soon filled by a freshly downloaded entity<MOOD>Neutral<> from their Convergence.
      For a moment, I think I hear a faint hum from within my Exosuit. But when I focus, it is gone. Perhaps I imagined it.
    exp_npc_res_b_24: |-
      The divergent Korvax screams, then uploads themself elsewhere.
      As is the way with these electronic beings, the empty husk is soon filled by a fresh mind from their Convergence. <MOOD>Positive<>They thank me for not aiding the rogue entity.
    exp_npc_desc_25: The electronic lifeform is busy on their datapad, tapping frustratedly
      at a long equation. They turn to me and reveal the screen.
    dnt_exp_npc_lang_25: Endless numbers... 16... endless trouble... Traveller, offer
      assistance?
    exp_npc_desc_25a: 'They seem to be processing a signal that emanates from a distant
      location deep in space, attempting to crack the code of a strange mathematical
      language. '
    exp_npc_opt_a_25: Tap the datapad
    exp_npc_opt_b_25: Offer additional microchips
    exp_npc_opt_c_25: Say '16'
    exp_npc_res_a_25: |-
      I take the datapad from the entity and attempt to crack the code. My fumbling entries are to no avail, and only serve to reset several screens of already processed information.
      %NAME% snatches the pad back, upset.
    exp_npc_res_b_25: |-
      I hand a small collection of microprocessors to the entity, hoping to be of assistance. They use this fresh silicon to boost their processing power.
      It appears to have worked, at least in part. They manage to decode some navigation data from the signal. They share the coordinates with me.
    exp_npc_res_c_25: "%NAME% pauses, alarmed. They stare at me, then wave me away.
      They shovel handfuls of nanites in my direction, as if to encourage my departure."
    war_npc_desc_1: |-
      The warrior looks at me with fire in their eyes. This species is clearly aggressive, and I doubt I'm welcome.
      Nonetheless, the lifeform bows in greeting. Tradition and honor perhaps dictate it.

      I don't feel in danger, and am about to turn and leave when the creature points towards my Multi-Tool. They bark with concern, and motion to suggest that I should hand it over.
    war_npc_desc_1_dust: The warrior stares at me with hostile, fiery eyes. They look
      at my dusty, sand-worn Exosuit with disdain. Nonetheless, the lifeform bows
      in greeting. Tradition and honor perhaps dictate it.
    war_npc_desc_1_lush: The warrior stares at me with hostile, fiery eyes. They look
      with disdain at my Exosuit, still covered with mud and grass from my time on
      this planet. Nonetheless, the lifeform bows in greeting. Tradition and honor
      perhaps dictate it.
    war_npc_desc_1_tox: The warrior stares at me with hostile, fiery eyes. They look
      with disdain at my Exosuit, corroded and slimy from my exposure to the toxic
      air outside. Nonetheless, the lifeform bows in greeting. Tradition and honor
      perhaps dictate it.
    war_npc_desc_1_rad: The warrior stares at me with hostile, fiery eyes. I must
      look pitiful, decayed by my exposure to the planet's radioactive atmosphere.
      Nonetheless, the lifeform bows in greeting. Tradition and honor perhaps dictate
      it.
    war_npc_desc_1_cold: The warrior stares at me with hostile, fiery eyes. I must
      seem pitiful to them, frozen and bedraggled after my time outside. Nonetheless,
      the lifeform bows in greeting. Tradition and honor perhaps dictate it.
    war_npc_desc_1_hot: The warrior stares at me with hostile, fiery eyes. I must
      look pitiful to them, baked and exhausted by the relentless sun. Nonetheless,
      the lifeform bows in greeting. Tradition and honor perhaps dictate it.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_1: Grah! The interloper weapon is pathetic! The honourable Vy'keen
      pity you! I will replace it!
    war_npc_desc_1a: I don't feel in danger, and am about to turn and leave when the
      creature points towards my Multi-Tool. They bark with concern, and motion to
      suggest that I should hand it over.
    war_npc_opt_a_1: Hand over the Multi-Tool
    war_npc_opt_b_1: Refuse to relinquish the Multi-Tool
    war_npc_res_a_1: |-
      The warrior nods in satisfaction. They take my Multi-Tool and examine it, holding it close before tossing it away with a derisory snort.
      Instead, they offer me an improved replacement Multi-Tool.
    war_npc_res_b_1: The warrior is impressed by my refusal. They respect my decision,
      and hand me an upgrade module with which to improve my Multi-Tool.
    war_npc_desc_2: The warrior's nostrils flare in hope and expectation. They show
      me their personal datapad, revealing a set of highly-detailed military plans.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_2: Interloper! Vy'keen allegiance? Or vile, pathetic, weak-minded
      Sentinel allegiance?
    war_npc_desc_2a: On one side of the battlefield stands the creature's own warrior
      race, and on the other the robotic Sentinels. The warrior demands that I point
      to one side or the other.
    war_npc_opt_a_2: Point to the warriors
    war_npc_opt_b_2: Point to the sentinels
    war_npc_res_a_2: The warrior grunts, nodding enthusiastically. They mark our new
      friendship by handing me tribute.
    war_npc_res_b_2: The warrior is outraged. They gesture wildly, their anger barely
      contained. My choice has gravely offended them.
    war_npc_desc_3: The warrior seems furious with themself. They slam their Multi-Tool
      onto a nearby surface, pulling the trigger again and again to no avail.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_3: Grah! Pathetic warrior! Weak-minded warrior! Weapon ammunition
      depleted!
    war_npc_desc_3a: Their weapons systems look functional, but the end result is
      nothing more than a hollow and empty click. The lifeform howls in self-loathing.
    war_npc_opt_a_3: Offer ammunition
    war_npc_opt_b_3: Offer carbon
    war_npc_opt_c_3: Comfort warrior
    war_npc_res_a_3: I hand %NAME% a handful of ammunition. The fire returns to their
      eyes, and they bow deeply. Barking happily, they offer me a gift in exchange.
    war_npc_res_b_3: |-
      The carbon I supply to %NAME% should be enough to recharge their mining beam. A brief look of disappointment flickers over their face. I suspect they were hoping for something more deadly.
      <MOOD>Positive<>The look quickly fades, however. They are ready - if slightly under equipped - for battle. They bark their thanks, and offer me a gift in exchange.
    war_npc_res_c_3: I rest my hand on %NAME%'s shoulder in sympathy.<MOOD>Negative<>
      Outraged, they head-butt me.
    war_npc_desc_4: The warrior looks up from a screen of flashing alerts. They bare
      their teeth at me, quivering with barely contained fury.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_4: Pathetic interloper! Leave! Warrior busy with facility security
      breach reports! Death! Death!
    war_npc_desc_4a: It's clear that my presence is barely tolerated here. The warrior's
      hand reaches to their weapon.
    war_npc_opt_a_4: Leave the warrior alone
    war_npc_opt_b_4: Offer to help
    war_npc_opt_c_4: Stare
    war_npc_res_a_4: "%NAME% grunts, grateful that I will not bother them any further."
    war_npc_res_b_4: I step forwards, ready to help. %NAME% takes this as a challenge,
      a question of their competence. They are outraged. They <AUDIO>WPN_PL_MELEE<>slap
      me hard across the face.
    war_npc_res_c_4: I stay where I am, staring at the warrior. My continued presence
      unsettles them. Eventually, they offer me a handful of nanites if I leave.
    war_npc_opt_post_a: Accept
    war_npc_opt_post_b: Refuse
    war_npc_res_post_b: "%NAME% loses their patience. Barking, they <AUDIO>WPN_PL_MELEE<>strike
      me with their weapon."
    war_npc_desc_5: The warrior's facial markings draw into a smirk as they look me
      up and down. I feel like I'm being sized up as a potential combatant.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_5: Pathetic interloper! Show strength and attack the noble Vy'keen
      warrior!
    war_npc_desc_5a: 'The creature points to an intriguing piece of technology on
      their datapad, then points to their own face. I''m being goaded into punching
      them. '
    war_npc_opt_a_5: Strike the warrior
    war_npc_opt_b_5: Refuse to attack
    war_npc_res_a_5: "<AUDIO>WPN_PL_MELEE<>The warrior strikes back with astonishing
      force. They bark out<MOOD>Positive<> laughter before handing me an upgrade module."
    war_npc_res_b_5: The warrior makes an unpleasant gesture. They appear to be suggesting
      that I am a coward.
    war_npc_desc_6: The warrior seems pleased to see me. They bark twice, then display
      two carved objects on their datapad. The artifacts are old, and it feels strange
      to see such ancient creations displayed in this manner.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_6: Interloper! Vy'keen High Command demands answers. The aggression
      interloper, or the defence interloper?
    war_npc_desc_6a: The first artifact is a chipped and bloody blade. The second
      is a battered shield. %NAME% barks, imploring me to make a decision.
    war_npc_opt_a_6: Choose the blade
    war_npc_opt_b_6: Choose the shield
    war_npc_res_a_6: The warrior emits a short, almost melodic, sequence of barks.
      They appear pleased by my choice. Bowing, they hand me an upgrade for my Multi-Tool.
    war_npc_res_b_6: "%NAME%'s eyes narrow. They stare at me suspiciously. Nonetheless,
      they appear to accept my choice. They offer a curt bow, no more than an incline
      of the head, and hand me an upgrade for my Exosuit."
    war_npc_desc_7: The warrior grabs at my Multi-Tool, stares at it dismissively
      and then starts yapping straight into my face. The yaps turn into slow hollow
      barks. They are unimpressed, and dramatically so at that.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_7: Interloper! Your pathetic Multi-Tool insults my ancestors!
      My wares create friendship, and blood! Death! Death!
    war_npc_desc_7a: Suddenly a holographic catalogue of armaments and attachments
      appears. The warrior opens their arms wide, and embraces me.<MOOD>Positive<>
      Alien sales traditions are a curious thing...
    war_npc_opt_a_7: Pay for Exosuit upgrade
    war_npc_opt_b_7: Pay for Multi-Tool upgrade
    war_npc_res_a_7: The warrior laughs, then strikes my Exosuit with a force that
      sets off alarms on its internal gyroscope. I believe they intended to show pleasure
      at my decision. They take my units and hand me an upgrade for my Exosuit.
    war_npc_res_b_7: The warrior cheers, embracing me in a hug that nearly crushes
      my ribcage. They take my units and immediately hand me an upgrade for my Multi-Tool.
    war_npc_desc_8_dust: The warrior is browsing a map of the surrounding desert.
      Certain areas contain markings that represent Sentinels, which the lifeform
      is highlighting with an excited snarl. They bark a question, but it sounds more
      like a command.
    war_npc_desc_8_lush: The warrior is browsing a map of the surrounding forests.
      Certain areas contain markings that represent Sentinels, which the lifeform
      is highlighting with an excited snarl. They bark a question, but it sounds more

      is highlighting with an excited snarl. They bark a question, but it sounds more
      like a command.

      is highlighting with an excited snarl. They bark a question, but it sounds more
      like a command.

      Certain areas contain markings that represent Sentinels, which the lifeform
      is highlighting with an excited snarl. They bark a question, but it sounds more
      like a command.
    war_npc_desc_8_hot: The warrior is browsing a map of the scorched scrubland outside.
      Certain areas contain markings that represent Sentinels, which the lifeform
      is highlighting with an excited snarl. They bark a question, but it sounds more
      like a command.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_8: Interloper! A great Sentinel hunt begins today. I demand ammunition.
    war_npc_desc_8a: "%NAME% stares at me, expecting an answer. As they wait, they
      stroke their boltcaster nervously, teasing at the ammunition hopper."
    war_npc_opt_a_8: Give ammunition
    war_npc_opt_b_8: Refuse
    war_npc_res_a_8: The warrior nods. They are satisfied by my donation to their
      hunt, and present me with a gift in exchange.
    war_npc_res_b_8: The warrior curses my name, my ancestors, and all who would follow
      after me. They raise their weapon and attempt to fire, only to hear an empty
      click. They howl with frustration.
    war_npc_desc_9: The warrior is tracking the paths of hundreds of warships across
      a galactic map, all converging on the same planetary system. This does not bode
      particularly well for the system in question, which appears to be populated
      by beaked traders of some variety.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_9: Grah! Fuel! I need fuel to join my brothers in honourable
      war! Death! Death!
    war_npc_desc_9a: A course plotted by the warrior itself has come up short. They
      cannot make the complete journey. They slam their fist against the terminal
      and howl until spittle flecks my visor.
    war_npc_opt_a_9: Give fuel
    war_npc_opt_b_9: Refuse to help
    war_npc_res_a_9: The warrior yelps out three joyful barks. Looking around for
      something to give in exchange, they extract an upgradule module from their Multi-Tool.
      They hand it over with great ceremony.
    war_npc_res_b_9: The warrior snarls and waves me away with an angry gesture. They
      snap at me, miming as if to say I have a beak.
    war_npc_desc_10: The warrior barks abruptly and flourishes a knife. They stare
      directly into my eyes as they draw the blade over the palm of their hand. Black
      bubbles of blood emerge through the slit in their glove.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_10: Interloper! Prove your worth! Vy'keen reward the brave and
      foolhardy!
    war_npc_desc_10a: They hand me the knife, clearly wanting me to reciprocate. They
      bark a little challenge and pat the storage container by their side. This will
      probably hurt...
    war_npc_opt_a_10: Cut open hand
    war_npc_opt_b_10: Refuse politely
    war_npc_res_a_10: The warrior grabs my bleeding hand and spits on it. They reward
      me for my part in this rite.
    war_npc_res_b_10: The warrior sneers at me, as if I have fulfilled their expectation.
    war_npc_desc_11_dust: A red, jagged and recent bite mark is wrapped around the
      entirety of the warrior's neck. Claw marks scar their chest, and their Exosuit
      lights flash red. The wound appears to be infected, clogged by dust and sand.
    war_npc_desc_11_lush: A red, jagged and recent bite mark is wrapped around the
      entirety of the warrior's neck. Claw marks scar their chest, and their Exosuit
      lights flash red. The wound appears to be infected, host to strange green spores.
    war_npc_desc_11_tox: A red, jagged and recent bite mark is wrapped around the
      entirety of the warrior's neck. Claw marks scar their chest, and their Exosuit
      lights flash red. The wound oozes a strange, caustic slime.
    war_npc_desc_11_rad: A red, jagged and recent bite mark is wrapped around the
      entirety of the warrior's neck. Claw marks scar their chest, and their Exosuit
      lights flash red. The wound pulsates, infected by radioactive spores.
    war_npc_desc_11_cold: A red, jagged and recent bite mark is wrapped around the
      entirety of the warrior's neck. Blood and flesh alike look frozen and raw. Claw
      marks scar their chest, and their Exosuit lights flash red.
    war_npc_desc_11_hot: A red, jagged and recent bite mark is wrapped around the
      entirety of the warrior's neck. The skin around the wound is badly burned; the
      flesh taut and raw. Claw marks scar their chest, and their Exosuit lights flash
      red.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_11: Victory in battle, interloper! My suit malfunctions, but
      the Vy'keen Ancients smile!
    war_npc_desc_11a: The lifeform barks contentedly at me, satisfied by their narrow
      victory. It's clear, however, that the warrior's injuries are severe. They have
      trouble breathing.
    war_npc_opt_a_11: Recharge their Exosuit
    war_npc_opt_b_11: Share oxygen
    war_npc_opt_c_11: Congratulate them
    war_npc_res_a_11: The warrior's healing systems come back online. They put on
      a show of protest, gesturing that they were fine. However, they discreetly offer
      me an upgrade module in thanks.
    war_npc_res_b_11: "%NAME% puts on a show of protest, gesturing that they are fine.
      However, they discretely accept my offer and recharge their life support system.
      They offer me an upgrade module in thanks."
    war_npc_res_c_11: The warrior nods, ignoring the pain, too proud to ask for help.
      Inhaling deeply, they revel in the suffering and glory of victory.
    war_npc_desc_12: The warrior is clutching a small metal idol. As I approach, their
      eyes glaze over in a strange white sheen. I hear them mutter strange incantations
      that get louder, then louder again.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_12: Hirk bless the fuel! Hirk bless the weapon charge! Hirk bless
      the fuel! Hirk bless the weapon charge!
    war_npc_desc_12a: Without waiting to ask permission, they thrust their hands into
      my inventory, searching for the elements within. They burn with a strange intensity.
      The experience is terrifying.
    war_npc_opt_a_12: Give metal
    war_npc_opt_b_12: Give carbon
    war_npc_opt_c_12: Fend them off
    war_npc_res_a_12: |-
      The warrior priest's hands weave around my offering. They continue to chant, their barks growing fiercer.
      With a flourish, these common elements are transformed into nanite clusters. They step back, quiet and exhausted.
    war_npc_res_b_12: The warrior priest’s hands somehow improve my offering.
    war_npc_res_c_12: The warrior priest recoils. They stare down at where I shoved
      them, a look of disgust and terror on their face, as if my hands have tainted
      them.
    war_npc_desc_13: "The warrior is silent for a second, before looking at me conspiratorially.

      - and take back their weapon. They will die in glorious battle.
    war_npc_desc_15: The lifeform clicks their heels together in an authoritarian

      I stand tall and bark at the warrior as fiercely as I can, attempting to resemble a Vy'keen of high rank. %NAME% looks astonished.
      Conditioned by years of obedience, they become cowed, apologetic. They hand over their own Multi-Tool as tribute.
    war_npc_desc_16: The warrior is old, and of a high rank. They take their time

      to bridge this divide.
    war_npc_res_b_17: The warrior grunts in satisfaction. Impressed by both my gift
      and my understanding, they teach me several new words of their language.

      later, the warrior awakes from their trance. They notice their missing belongings
      and rage at me. I leave, quickly.
    war_npc_desc_19: The downbeat lifeform is studying the image of another young
      warrior on their pad. The pictured warrior looks virile and impressive. They
      have facial tendrils that are outstretched. They appear rich, and of good breeding
      stock. The look in their eyes is... sultry.

      this fate. Discreetly, they hand me the gift they had prepared for their new
      clan.
    war_npc_res_c_19: I take the pad and attempt to send a message on behalf of the
      nervous warrior, but there appears to be some sort of misunderstanding by the
      recipient. I receive generous gifts, and a candid image of the lifeform I will
      one day wed.

      a sequence of furious barks and screams that clearly have a moral high ground.

      revived, eager where they had been afraid. They roar in anticipation of the
      fight ahead, then thank me with a generous gift.
    war_npc_res_b_20: |-
      As the warrior takes the dagger, their nervousness seems to leave them. They let it settle in their grip, assessing its weight. Satisfied, a grimace spreads across their face.

    war_npc_res_c_20: "%NAME% looks shocked. They had been frightened, but had never
      considered cowardice. They shake their head at me, offended."
    war_npc_desc_21: The warrior is building some sort of bomb. The plans they hold
      in their hand are unmistakable. A complicated sequence of blueprints and isotopic
      chemical reactions is waiting for the final addition of an element to be complete.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_21: Grah! Vy'keen war preparation nears completion! Death to

      wide-eyed, then let forth a roar of delight. They thank me with gifts of their
      own, and excitedly get to work. I fear for what I may have unleashed...
    war_npc_res_b_21: I hand the warrior a packet of explosives. They take it, shifting
      it from hand to hand, assessing it. Pleased, they thump me on the chest appreciatively.
      They thank me by way of an upgrade module, and begin plotting their targets...
    war_npc_res_c_21: The warrior snarls. They do not need me, and have no interest
      in my objections. They will not let my anything disrupt their mission...
    war_npc_desc_22: The storage vault at the warrior's feet shows clear signs of
      tampering. In fact, an explosive device has been attached to its hinges. The
      lifeform sees my shocked expression, and yaps in amusement.
    dnt_war_npc_lang_22: Grah! Pathetic distant warrior leave powerful Multi-Tool
      in storage vault! Avoid processed element usage in explosion - too powerful!
      Raw element required!
    war_npc_desc_22a: The bomb needs fuel for ignition, which would most likely blow
      the vault wide open. The warrior impatiently tries to explain what should happen
      next...
    war_npc_opt_a_22: Order them to stop
    war_npc_opt_b_22: Sabotage device
    war_npc_res_a_22: The lock on the vault is blown clear off. I retrieve a Multi-Tool

      wave sweeps across the facility.<DELAY>0.4<> Almost immediately, the terminal
      screen clears up. The production facility is back online.
    tra_fac_res_c_7: |-
      I throw the master power switch that sits alongside the terminal. The facility powers down. I reset the switch, and hope...
      It does not power back up again.
    tra_fac_desc_9: The wail of an alarm fills my ears, but the system is not reacting
      to my intrusion. Someone else has been here and modified this terminal before.
      I struggle to decipher the data on the terminal.
    dnt_tra_fac_lang_9: Warning! Unexpected system detected! Bypass chip template
      detected! Gek Trade Federation informed!
    tra_fac_desc_9a: Whatever code has been loaded on the terminal is clearly the
      work of some enterprising thief. It appears to be emptying the resource vaults
      of rare metals.
    tra_fac_opt_a_9: Revert system
    tra_fac_opt_b_9: Attempt further hijack
    tra_fac_res_a_9: I reset the system back to its default production loadout. Things
      appear to be operating as expected.
    tra_fac_res_b_9: I attempt to perform my own hijack of the terminal. It reroutes
      some of the automated profit flows directly to my account. However, my intrusion
      is clearly not subtle enough. Anti-tampering systems react and lock me out of
      the terminal.
    tra_fac_desc_11: Despite the warnings sounding out across the facility, the terminal
      remains open and ready for commerce. A brief introductory message blinks on
      the screen.
    dnt_tra_fac_lang_11: Friend! Know language, know commerce! Units buy knowledge!
      Choose Vy'keen, choose Korvax or choose a refresher in the language of the benevolent
      Gek!
    tra_fac_desc_11a: Three columns of words endlessly scroll on-screen, each in a
      strange alphabet. Bloodied runes scratched in sand, a precise sequences of dots,
      and a hand-written font full of exclamatory punctuation.
    tra_fac_opt_a_11: Select bloodied runes
    tra_fac_opt_b_11: Select dot patterns
    tra_fac_opt_c_11: Select handwritten font
    tra_fac_res_a_11: As I scan the runes, I feel a deep-seated roar rattle around
      my mind. A word sears itself into my brain, the language of a distant warrior
      race.
    tra_fac_res_b_11: The dots race across the screen, an elegant, dancing pattern.
      I settle into the rhythm, and suddenly feel a burst of comprehension.<DELAY>0.4<>A
      word sears itself into my brain. I feel altered by the process.
    tra_fac_res_c_11: I feel a chittering glee as I scan the words the terminal presents.
      My other senses are affected, and I feel almost as if I could smell the language.
      Suddenly, a word sears itself into my brain, a fragment of Gek speech.
    tra_fac_desc_12: Alarms echo across the facility, a warning against my intrusion.
      Such an alert does not appear to slow down the commercial needs of the Gek,
      however. A nearby trade-ship is hailing the facility, looking for goods.
    dnt_tra_fac_lang_12: Gek Trade Federation dispatch! Planetary metal demand high!
      Collection ship imminent!
    tra_fac_desc_12a: Perhaps if I were to offer goods of my own, I might both turn
      a profit and avoid alerting the Gek that there is an intruder in their facility...
    tra_fac_opt_a_12: Trade sodium
    tra_fac_opt_b_12: Trade ferrite
    tra_fac_opt_c_12: Trade carbon
    tra_fac_res_a_12: A relieved beaked trader shouts their thanks through the speaker
      systems. The success of the transaction appears to convince the security systems
      that I am a legitimate user.
    tra_fac_res_b_12: The terminal shuts down rapidly. I can only assume my reply
      gave me away, and the trader alerted the authorities to my intrusion.
    tra_fac_res_c_12: |-
      The trade vault slams shut.

      I only receive a small payment.
    tra_fac_desc_13: 'My dramatic entry appears to have caused a fire alert. The screen
      is wet to the touch. A warning flashes on the terminal:'

    tra_fac_res_a_13: The system sputters a little, showing signs of life. But it
      is not to be - a shower of sparks reveals a short-circuit within the flooded
      terminal. It closes down, the facility lifeless.
    tra_fac_res_b_13: |-
      The drained resource vault feeds rare elements into the production system.

      The facility is back online.
    tra_fac_res_c_13: Despite a dramatic gurgling from beneath my feet, the facility
      remains offline. The terminal, fatally damaged, shorts out.
    tra_fac_desc_14: I open the terminal, looking for a way to shut off the alarm.
      Primary access appears to be via some sort of hand scanner.
    tra_fac_opt_pre_14: Scan hand
    tra_fac_desc_14a: |-
      I place my Exosuit glove upon the indent.
      Without warning, a thousand tiny needles shoot out of the reader, meshing my hand to the machine. A synthetic voice speaks to me.
    dnt_tra_fac_lang_14: Friend healing and repair station initializing! Please, be
      happy!
    tra_fac_opt_a_14: Fire Multi-Tool
    tra_fac_opt_b_14: Struggle
    tra_fac_opt_c_14: Wait
    tra_fac_res_a_14: I grab my Multi-Tool with my free hand and fire at the terminal.<DELAY>0.4<>
      It explodes, releasing its grip. A few shards of metal remain embedded in my
      fingers, but I am free.
    tra_fac_res_b_14: I struggled against the grip of the machine. As I pull, my hand
      rips free. The terminal is covered in blood.
    tra_fac_res_c_14: |-
      A beautiful, clean feeling overcomes me. The terminal pumps some sort of healing fluid into my Exosuit. I feel utterly refreshed.
      The process completes, and the facility accepts me as one if its own.
    tra_fac_desc_15: The alarm has rebooted the facility. An automated start-up routine
      is running. The terminal flashes text at me, clearly expecting some input.
    dnt_tra_fac_lang_15: Warning! Product recipe unselected! Assign recipe! Gek Trade
      Federation lose units!
    tra_fac_desc_15a: A 3D interface waits in front of me, awaiting a blueprint for
      the facility to mass-produce. Machines around me hum as they warm up...

    tra_fac_opt_b_15: Sketch synthetic plants
    tra_fac_opt_c_15: Sketch confectionery
    tra_fac_res_a_15: The terminal accepts my design and the installation start-up
      procedure completes. I hope the Gek who run this facility are happy with my
      choice.
    tra_fac_res_b_15: The terminal accepts my design and the installation start-up
      procedure completes. The Gek who run this facility may appreciate the extra
      green in their environment.
    tra_fac_res_c_15: The terminal accepts my design and the installation start-up
      procedure completes. I hope the Gek who run this facility are happy with their
      vast pile of sugar.
    tra_fac_desc_16: The facility's machinery lies still, halted by the emergency
      shutdown. A short message blinks on the control terminal.
    dnt_tra_fac_lang_16: User warning! Production disengaged. Restart generator empty.
      No fuel. Facility restart requires organic fuel.

      I feed the fuel tank with a catalyst, hoping to boost the effect of whatever material powers this facility.
      I throw the switch. <DELAY>0.66<> A low rumble is followed by a loud explosion deep within the facility. The terminal immediately cuts out.
    tra_fac_res_b_16: |-
      I feed a large amount of ferrite dust into the system's fuel supply. The pipes become sticky and choked, the dust mixing with the residue of other fuels.
      I throw the switch, but to no avail. The generator system splurts and coughs before shutting down completely.
    tra_fac_res_c_16: |-
      The carbon-based fuel slips down the hopper's metal throat. I hear a gurgle as it feeds into the generator system.
      I throw the switch. <DELAY>0.8<> The generator ticks over, then roars into life. The surge of power from the generator triggers the facility's main reactor, and the machinery comes back online.
    tra_fac_desc_22: An unknown fault has forced the whole system offline. There is
      a strange chill in the air, a sharp clarity to the atmosphere.
    dnt_tra_fac_lang_22: Alert! Alert! Liquid frenium leak! Charge cylinders frozen!
      Increase temperature!
    tra_fac_desc_22a: I exhale as I ponder the words on the terminal. Condensation
      begins to cloud my visor.
    tra_fac_opt_a_22: Activate incineration banks
    tra_fac_opt_b_22: Supercharge coolant flow
    tra_fac_opt_c_22: Initialize charge cylinder sequence
    tra_fac_res_a_22: Warmth spreads through the facility. The air around me remains
      strange to look at, but the production systems return online.
    tra_fac_res_b_22: The system remains frozen. If anything, the air around me becomes
      even icier. Strange crystals frost over the surface of the terminal as it shuts
      down.
    tra_fac_res_c_22: The noise of muffled explosions can be heard beneath my feet.
      The facility does become rapidly warmer, but all systems shut down dramatically.
    tra_fac_desc_23: Emergency measures have been initialized. The timestamp on the
      terminal's error reporting display shows that the incident occurred long before
      my intrusion.

    tra_fac_opt_b_23: Acidify heridium tanks
    tra_fac_opt_c_23: Release suspension fluid
    tra_fac_res_a_23: |-
      There is a hiss as the alkaline solution floods the facility's pipes. Machinery strains, trying to break free of the blockage in the gears.
      With an unsettling snap, the production facility comes back online. The remains of the lifeform must have been washed free of the mechanisms.
    tra_fac_res_b_23: The air takes on a curious acidic tang. Fragile wires in the
      terminal corrode rapidly. The display shorts out, and then shuts down entirely.
    tra_fac_res_c_23: A frenzied chemical reaction can be heard somewhere beneath
      my feet. The terminal - and the rest of the facility - shuts down entirely.
    tra_fac_desc_24: The terminal barks a repeated warning. Though the words are unclear,
      the symbol is instantly recognizable. Something, somewhere in the facility is
      on fire.
    dnt_tra_fac_lang_24: Resource vault fire detected! Element stockpile destroyed!

      I hear a hiss as the air drains from the machinery chambers beneath my feet. The heat levels remain steady, however.
      The control terminal enters an automated shutdown.
    tra_fac_res_b_24: |-
      I hear a hiss as the air drains from the resource vaults beneath my feet. Slowly but surely the heat levels start to drop. The fire is under control.
      Enough remains in the vault that I should be able to restore the facility to operational status.
    tra_fac_res_c_24: The facility sprinkler showers above my head. It has no impact
      on the internal fire, but does short out the control terminal.
    tra_fac_desc_25: My entry has caused the facility to go into immediate lockdown,
      interrupting its operation. Visual readouts on the terminal indicate that this
      is a deep-level mining facility. Its resource vaults are emptying rapidly.
    dnt_tra_fac_lang_25: Drilling error! Elements drain into planet core! Reverse

    tra_fac_opt_c_25: Reverse tunnel pressurization
    tra_fac_res_a_25: I hear a deep, distant noise, a subterranean roll of thunder.
      The resource vaults empty entirely, drained into the earth. The facility remains
      offline.
    tra_fac_res_b_25: The drilling rig retracts from the shaft, but this only seems
      to accelerate the loss of material. The dials spin furiously before settling.
      The resource vaults are empty, drained into the earth. The facility remains
      offline.
    tra_fac_res_c_25: I hear a deep, distant noise, a subterranean roll of thunder.
      Slowly the resource vaults beneath the surface stop spilling their contents
      into the earth, and eventually begin to refill. The facility comes back online.
    exp_fac_desc_1: My unauthorized intrusion has activated an alert on the control
      terminal. Its lights flash an angry, hostile red.
    dnt_exp_fac_lang_1: Reboot initialised. Data loss probability warning. Offsite
      back-up detonation initialised.

      the screen comes back to life. All trace of the security programme has vanished.
    exp_fac_res_b_1: My attempt to meddle is detected immediately. The system reboots
      to a blank screen. All data has been lost.
    exp_fac_res_c_1: As I wait, the countermeasures complete their purge of the system.
      The terminal shuts down, its screen a lifeless black.

    exp_fac_opt_a_3: Attempt reconstruction
    exp_fac_opt_b_3: Delete file
    exp_fac_res_a_3: The data recovery operation completes successfully. One by one
      the errors clear from the terminal screen.
    exp_fac_res_b_3: Manually deleting the corrupted file appears to free the machine
      from its degenerate loop. I can only hope it contained nothing valuable.
    exp_fac_desc_4: The facility rings with the blare of an alarm. However, it appears
      I am not the first intruder. The terminal display indicates a previous hijack
      attempt.
    dnt_exp_fac_lang_4: Virus detection warning! File extracting valuable data!

      Control returning to overseer imminently!
    exp_fac_desc_5a: The scan continues. It seems to be consuming all the facility's
      resources, preventing other operations. A large red override button blinks temptingly.
    exp_fac_opt_a_5: Cancel planetary scan
    exp_fac_opt_b_5: Wait
    exp_fac_res_a_5: I hit the override button. The scan data is deleted.<DELAY>0.8<>
      A remote process, detecting the premature end of the scan, shuts down the entire

      I hear the whirr of gears and the hissing of metal cable. The facility shudders slightly as the machinery bites into the cable and begins to pull.
      After an agonizing delay, the terminal reports a successful extraction. The alarms cease.
    exp_fac_res_b_7: I try several times to restart the probe. It fails to respond
      to my commands. Meanwhile, the malfunction alerts grow ever harsher.
    exp_fac_res_c_7: I hear a deep, distant noise, a subterranean roll of thunder.
      Alerts and alarms fill the terminal screen, most of them flashing angrily. The
      terminal refuses to accept further input.
    exp_fac_desc_8: |-
      Alarms blare, sounding out against my intrusion. The facility is remotely operated, and no-one responds to the klaxon's call.

      facility.
    exp_fac_res_b_16: I seal off the facility's primary motherboard. However, vital
      control systems appear to have been damaged beyond repair.<DELAY>0.4<> The entirely
      facility starts to shut down.
    exp_fac_res_c_16: I safeguard the control units that house the facility's primary
      AI.<DELAY>0.4<> With the computer running the facility, the appropriate countermeasures
      are soon deployed and the hostile environment purged.
    exp_fac_desc_18: Operations are offline. A recent research scan has been corrupted,
      likely by my unexpected interruption. It is crashing every system in the outpost.
    dnt_exp_fac_lang_18: Bad data. Sentinel drone activity scan corrupted. System
      disengaged.
    exp_fac_desc_18a: The terminal scrolls through a list of potentially corrupt files.
      I appear to have deletion rights...
    exp_fac_opt_a_18: Delete planetary quadruped scan
    exp_fac_opt_b_18: Delete Sentinel scan
    exp_fac_opt_c_18: Delete geological survey
    exp_fac_res_a_18: I delete a number of files related to the quadrupeds that guard
      the facility, but the system remains offline
    exp_fac_res_b_18: I delete an unusually large file, a scan the network process
      that controls the nearby Sentinel drones.<DELAY>0.5<> There is a sudden, large
      jump in available computational resources. The installation's primary processes
      begin to restart.
    exp_fac_res_c_18: I delete a number of geological data packets, but the system
      remains offline
    exp_fac_desc_19: Wild energy fluctuations have brought research operations to
      a standstill. When I touch the terminal to investigate, a residual electric
      charge earths itself through my Exosuit.
    dnt_exp_fac_lang_19: Alert! Electronic terminal operator power discharge! Reset
      primary interface!
    exp_fac_desc_19a: Readouts on the terminal indicate the power fluctuations are
      getting stronger and wilder. It will not be long before they bring down the
      entire facility.
    exp_fac_opt_a_19: Stabilize production battery
    exp_fac_opt_b_19: Reset primary terminal
    exp_fac_opt_c_19: Open fusion capacitor
    exp_fac_res_a_19: I attempt to stabilize the flow of power throughout the facility,
      but the fluctuations continue. The terminal begins to short out, then dramatically
      shuts down completely.
    exp_fac_res_b_19: I reset the primary interface. One by one, systems come back
      online. The power fluctuations cease.
    exp_fac_desc_20: Systems are super-charged despite the security alert. Equipment
      beneath my feet buzzes and whirrs with a high intensity. The terminal blinks
      a warning.
    dnt_exp_fac_lang_20: Danger! Excess power! Decrease energy use immediately! Delivery

    exp_fac_opt_b_20: Increase fan power delivery
    exp_fac_opt_c_20: Increase coolant power delivery
    exp_fac_res_a_20: I reduce power delivery across the board. The installation returns
      to acceptable activity levels.
    exp_fac_res_b_20: I turn up the cooling systems.<DELAY>0.5<> The added strain
      on power delivery leads to a small internal fire. The terminal shuts down.
    exp_fac_desc_21: I approach the terminal. It flashes the expected security alert,
      but alongside is a warning I have not seen before.
    dnt_exp_fac_lang_21: Unexpected biological blockage detected. Power delivery network
      disruption!
    exp_fac_desc_21a: 'A video feed shows a small creature is scrambling through the

    exp_fac_res_a_21: I boost power to the wiring loom.<DELAY>0.5<> A smell of roasted
      meat wafts up from the systems below. The system comes back online.
    exp_fac_res_b_21: I send a surge of highly acidic cleaning fluid through the pipes.
      <DELAY>0.5<> The creature is swept away. I hear a faint hiss as it bubbles away
      to nothingness. The system comes back online.
    exp_fac_res_c_21: I wait. Driven by the alarms, the creature struggles desperately
      for the exit. Eventually, it breaks free.<DELAY>0.4<> The system comes back
      online.
    exp_fac_desc_22: The alarm has triggered the instant incineration of the elements
      used here. The process they were being used for, however, is still online.
    dnt_exp_fac_lang_22: Databank back-up process stalled. Raw metal required to finish
      process.
    exp_fac_desc_22a: My scanner is picking up traces of metal, leftovers from the
      previous production process.
    exp_fac_opt_a_22: Supply metal
    exp_fac_opt_b_22: Insert purified metal
    exp_fac_opt_c_22: Insert rare metal
    exp_fac_res_a_22: I feed the metal back into the facility's supply hopper. Production
      comes back online.
    exp_fac_res_b_22: |-
      The facility takes in my element, before the resource vaults judder and spark.

      The system becomes non-operational.
    war_fac_desc_1: The alarm has locked the terminal. A message displays itself letter-by-letter
      on the screen.
    dnt_war_fac_lang_1: Suspicious interloper visual detection system initiated!
    war_fac_desc_1a: The alarm shows no sign of stopping. I notice wall-mounted security
      scanners slowly turn towards me...
    war_fac_opt_a_1: Shoot the cameras
    war_fac_opt_b_1: Apply override chip
    war_fac_opt_c_1: Cut input wires
    war_fac_res_a_1: |-
      I apply a rapid burst from my Multi-Tool directly to the facility's security cameras.
      This is a partial success: my image is not captured by the system, but backup sensors react to the destruction by shutting the facility down entirely.
    war_fac_res_b_1: I apply an override circuit to the security relay.<DELAY>0.5<>
      Remarkably, my ad-hoc wiring seems to work. The alarm stops, and the terminal
      grants me full access.
    war_fac_res_c_1: I snap the input wires that lead from the security system to
      the master control terminal.<DELAY>0.5<> Remarkably, this seems to work. The
      alarm stops, and the error seems to reset the terminal.
    war_fac_desc_2: I approach the terminal and search for a way to override the alarm.
      I find a likely looking button and press it, causing the terminal to respond.
    dnt_war_fac_lang_2: Grah! Vy'keen voice security scan initializing...
    war_fac_desc_2a: A flap flicks open and a microphone emerges. A distant voice
      shouts 'Grah!'.
    war_fac_opt_a_2: Bark 'Grah!'
    war_fac_opt_b_2: Say everything's fine
    war_fac_opt_c_2: Apologize
    war_fac_res_a_2: I bark aggressively at the terminal. This appears to satisfy
      whatever demand was being made of me. Access is granted.
    war_fac_res_b_2: I attempt to explain, but my hesitant speech instantly marks
      me out as an interloper. The security system delivers a high-voltage shock to
      my Exosuit before shutting down the terminal.
    war_fac_res_c_2: I apologize, but this display of weakness instantly marks me
      out as an interloper. The security system delivers a high-voltage shock to my
      Exosuit before shutting down the terminal.
    war_fac_desc_3: I approach the terminal. As the alarm blares, a laser scan refracts
      through my visor, then another traces the air around my breathing exhaust. The
      terminal flashes a warning.
    dnt_war_fac_lang_3: Intruder detected! Respiration gas concentration high! Enemy
      respiration!!
    war_fac_desc_3a: From what I can determine, it seems my breathing patterns may
      be giving me away as an interloper...
    war_fac_opt_a_3: Hold breath
    war_fac_opt_b_3: Breathe aggressively
    war_fac_opt_c_3: Deploy Vy'keen Dagger
    war_fac_res_a_3: I hold my breath.<DELAY>0.5<> An age seems to pass.<DELAY>0.4<>
      Finally, moments before I lose consciousness, the terminal flashes a green light.
      I have been accepted as a Vy'keen.
    war_fac_res_b_3: I breathe as aggressively as I can, channeling my anger at the
      gas sensor.<DELAY>0.3<> It has no effect. The terminal registers my failure
      and shuts down.
    war_fac_res_c_3: |-
      I inhale deeply before stabbing myself with the dagger.<DELAY>0.5<>. I feel so alive; shot through with adrenaline; blood pumping hard through my veins; sparks crackling down my nerves. It is glorious. Grah! Grah!
      The terminal accepts me as one of the Vy'keen and allows me access.
    war_fac_desc_4: The terminal flashes two alerts, presumably the source of the
      alarms currently ringing in my ears.
    dnt_war_fac_lang_4: 'Major security alert! Interloper detected! Minor alert: war
      factory entrance door destroyed.'
    war_fac_desc_4a: After printing out its status update, the terminal presents the
      option to override either alert. From the holographic display, the warnings
      appear to relate to damaged components within the facility, and the presence
      of an interloper.
    war_fac_opt_a_4: Override damage alert
    war_fac_opt_b_4: Override intruder alert
    war_fac_res_a_4: The facility becomes operational.
    war_fac_res_b_4: The terminal initiates an emergency shutdown.
    war_fac_desc_5: I approach the terminal, searching for a way to shut off the alarm.
      As I stand by the input device, the floor shifts beneath my feet.<DELAY>0.4<>
      I hear a click.
    dnt_war_fac_lang_5: Vy'keen security system alert! Pressure pad enemy detection
      confirmed! Too light! Too puny!
    war_fac_desc_5a: The screen has locked itself. It appears the facility is aware
      I am not the lifeform that usually operates here.
    war_fac_opt_a_5: Pick up metal debris
    war_fac_opt_b_5: Reduce weight
    war_fac_opt_c_5: Jump up and down
    war_fac_res_a_5: |-
      I pick up a large piece of scrap metal from the floor, presumably deposited there when I blew up the door.
      This has the desired effect: my weight has been increased to within the non-suspicious range for a Vy'keen warrior. The terminal grants me access.
    war_fac_res_b_5: I set aside my Multi-Tool, as well as other heavy items from
      my Exosuit's storage. The floor scales register a further series of clicks before
      the security system shuts me out entirely.
    war_fac_res_c_5: My rapid jumps appear to confuse whatever security device is
      embedded in the floor. Eventually, it either overloads or is convinced by my
      aggression that I am a true Vy'keen. I am granted full access to the facility.
    war_fac_desc_6: 'My presence has triggered a security alert. I hear elements being
      drawn from the vaults below me. On-screen: a clear countdown.'
    dnt_war_fac_lang_6: Intruder alert! Commence detonation sequence! Organic fuel
      flow initiated!
    war_fac_desc_6a: I can hear pressurized fluids filling the pipes surrounding the
      terminal. The sound is rather ominous, especially when combined with the high-intensity
      alarms...
    war_fac_opt_a_6: Block fuel lines
    war_fac_opt_b_6: Shutdown catalyst pipes
    war_fac_opt_c_6: Wait
    war_fac_res_a_6: |-
      I clamp the fuel lines. There is a brief moment of tension as pressure builds in the pipes.
      It stabilizes. The countdown ends, and nothing happens.<DELAY>0.4<> With some sort of disaster presumably averted, the terminal unlocks and grants me access.
    war_fac_res_b_6: I clamp the catalyst flow.<DELAY>0.8<> A minor explosion scorches
      my arm, before facility operations resume.
    war_fac_res_c_6: A blast of flame coats me from below.<DELAY>1<> The facility
      remains non-operational.
    war_fac_desc_7: 'Automated security procedures are incinerating the contents of
      all the vaults in the facility. The terminal displays the manifest:'
    dnt_war_fac_lang_7: 'Intruder alert! Incinerating trading vault: imminent. Incinerating
      power vault: imminent. Incinerating storage vault: imminent.'
    war_fac_desc_7a: Power surges are igniting the vaults one-by-one. However, the
      terminal appears to allow for limited emergency retrievals...
    war_fac_opt_a_7: Withdraw trade vault
    war_fac_opt_b_7: Withdraw relic vault
    war_fac_opt_c_7: Withdraw technology vault
    war_fac_res_a_7: I activate the emergency vault retrieval system. The drone just
      has time to extract the contents of the trade vault before all goods are incinerated.
    war_fac_res_b_7: I activate the emergency vault retrieval system. The drone just
      has time to extract the contents of the relic vault before all goods are incinerated.
    war_fac_res_c_7: I activate the emergency vault retrieval system. The drone just
      has time to extract the contents of the technology vault before all goods are
      incinerated.
    war_fac_desc_8: A transmission is firing on emergency frequencies. The terminal
      shows a response code from a nearby Vy'keen capital ship.
    dnt_war_fac_lang_8: Security breach! Military action unstoppable! Vy'keen High
      Command vessel coordinate upload imminent!
    war_fac_desc_8a: It seems to be responding to my intrusion. From the images on
      screen, it seems to be preparing its weapon systems...
    war_fac_opt_a_8: Broadcast safety code
    war_fac_opt_b_8: Hack in safety code
    war_fac_opt_c_8: Scramble facility coordinates
    war_fac_res_a_8: I transmit the safety override code, putting an end to the emergency
      transmission. The Vy'keen warship stands down, broadcasting a respectful 'Grah'.
      The terminal unlocks.
    war_fac_res_b_8: I attach a bypass circuit, allowing me to transmit the safety
      override code and put an end to the emergency transmission. The Vy'keen warship
      stands down, broadcasting a respectful 'Grah'. The terminal unlocks.
    war_fac_res_c_8: I attempt to scramble the facility's coordinates, hoping to throw
      off the incoming fire. <DELAY>0.4<>I hear a distant explosion and the screams
      of burning animals. The facility's processes return to normal.
    war_fac_desc_9: As I turn on the terminal, a forward-facing security scanner clicks
      and whirrs into focus. My bright red image is on-screen.
    dnt_war_fac_lang_9: Interloper detection! Heat detection systems confirm report!
      High temperature intruder!
    war_fac_desc_9a: The terminal allows me no further access. In the camera feed,
      blue lines cross the red of my body, matching exactly to my Exosuit's coolant
      mesh...
    war_fac_opt_a_9: Decrease coolant flow
    war_fac_opt_b_9: Increase coolant flow
    war_fac_res_a_9: |-
      I manually override my Exosuit's coolant flow. Slowly but surely a deep chill spreads across my body. My bones ache. My blood feels like ice, stabbing against every fiber of my being.
      The image on the terminal screen fades from a dramatic red to a total black. I am invisible. The security alert ends, and the terminal comes back online.
    war_fac_res_b_9: |-
      I manually override my Exosuit's coolant flow. Slowly but surely I feel a burning sensation spread across my body. I begin to sweat.
      The image on the terminal screen blooms a dramatic red. The security scan completes, and locks me out from the terminal entirely.
    war_fac_desc_12: The terminal indicates that this facility was not an automated
      one. The lifeform stationed here appears to have fled.
    dnt_war_fac_lang_12: Pathetic warrior learn Vy'keen language! Pass test or encounter
      fighting pits! ERROR ERROR INSERT CATALYST ERROR ERROR MALFUNCTION
    war_fac_desc_12a: It seems they left in the middle of some sort of exam. Perhaps
      I could complete their training for them...
    war_fac_opt_a_12: Insert metal
    war_fac_opt_b_12: Insert catalyst
    war_fac_opt_c_12: Insert organic element
    war_fac_res_a_12: |-
      The terminal rejects my input. It barks aggressively at me, and then closes down. It seems I have failed the test.
      I hope the lifeform who was supposed to complete it does not suffer any repercussions.
    war_fac_res_b_12: The comprehension test has been failed.
    war_fac_res_c_12: The terminal accepts my input. It barks aggressively at me,
      but does go on to grant full systems access. It seems I have passed the test.
      Perhaps the lifeform whose place I took will be grateful.
    war_fac_desc_13: A strange air hangs over the facility. Beyond the noise of the
      alarm, I cannot escape the feeling that something more sinister is at work.
      I search the terminal for clues.
    dnt_war_fac_lang_13: Grah! Initiate sentinel blood processing! Vaults full! Grah!
      Glass and blood! Glass and blood!
    war_fac_desc_13a: The text seems to float from the screen, aggressive; it seems
      like no facility AI I have ever encountered. Echoing up from deep underground,
      I hear the electronic wail of dying Sentinels...
    war_fac_opt_a_13: Shutdown facility AI
    war_fac_opt_b_13: Insert Pugneum
    war_fac_opt_c_13: Incinerate vaults
    war_fac_res_a_13: Overcome with suspicion, I initiate an emergency shutdown of
      the facility AI. The alarms fall silent. The sinister electronic wail ceases.
      Unfortunately, the terminal has become unresponsive.
    war_fac_res_b_13: |-
      I insert a supply of pugneum into the input hopper. Machinery jumps into life. The electronic wail becomes louder still. A moment passes.
      The sinister activity ends as strangely as it begun. The terminal returns to the familiar dull text of a facility control panel.
    war_fac_res_c_13: |-
      Overcome with suspicion, I initiate an emergency incineration of the facility's storage vaults. The sinister electronic wail grows louder, sharper, as the fires begin their work. Then, suddenly, silence.
      The strange atmosphere of the facility fades away. The terminal returns to the familiar dull text of a master control panel.
    war_fac_desc_16: |-
      The alarm hasn't disrupted the factory's production line. I hear the strain of heavy machinery beneath my feet; the crash and boom of industry in action.
      However, the terminal tells a less mighty tale. Something is wrong.
    dnt_war_fac_lang_16: Grah! Gek war preparation disrupted! Ammunition production
      stalled! Metal required!
    war_fac_desc_16a: The vaults seem to be empty. The machines clatter angrily, but
      produce nothing.
    war_fac_opt_a_16: Insert metal
    war_fac_opt_b_16: Insert di-hydrogen
    war_fac_opt_c_16: Insert sodium
    war_fac_res_a_16: I fill the input hopper with a fresh supply of ferrite. The
      machines continue to chatter, but now do so smoothly, their supply lines well-fed.
    war_fac_res_b_16: I fill the input hopper with a fresh supply of di-hydrogen.
      An explosion echos up from the machinery below. The highly reactive substance
      has caused some sort of industrial calamity.
    war_fac_res_c_16: I fill the input hopper with a fresh supply of sodium. An explosion
      echos up from the machinery below. The highly reactive substance has caused
      some sort of industrial calamity.
    war_fac_desc_17: The facility is full of blaring noise, an angry warning against
      my intrusion. The terminal shows a similarly angry message, apparently upset
      at the hitch in production.
    dnt_war_fac_lang_17: High Command demand explanation! Scare element required!
      Demand chromatic metal! Restore contributions!
    war_fac_desc_17a: It appears an off-world overseer is making demands. If I satisfy
      them, perhaps I'll be granted full access to the terminal...
    war_fac_opt_a_17: Issue counter-order
    war_fac_opt_b_17: Insert magnetized Ferrite
    war_fac_opt_c_17: Insert Chromatic Metal
    war_fac_res_a_17: The terminal relays an apologetic bark. The demand is waived.
      Full access is granted to the facility's control panel.
    war_fac_res_b_17: The terminal relays a confused and angry bark. The remote overseer
      shuts the terminal down completely, upset by my paltry contribution.
    war_fac_res_c_17: The terminal relays a resonant bark, the response of a happy
      warrior. With their demand satisfied, full access is restored to the facility's
      control panel.
    war_fac_desc_20: The terminal flashes an urgent warning. Some vital part of the
      facility has been compromised by the security alert.
    dnt_war_fac_lang_20: Intruder alert! Battle enzyme production halted! Electrical
      charge removed from body harvest circuit!
    war_fac_desc_20a: The display takes me aback.<DELAY>0.4<> A warrior's heart is
      on-screen, its beat irregular.<DELAY>0.3<> Connected to wires and artificial
      valves, it seems to pump a biological liquid through organs deep within the

    war_fac_opt_a_20: Increase electrical flow
    war_fac_opt_b_20: Initiate adrenalin flux
    war_fac_opt_c_20: Power down systems
    war_fac_res_a_20: |-
      I increase the power flow to the facility's heart. It judders, then establishes a regular beat. Its strange existence continues.
      With this emergency over, the terminal reverts to a standard factory input system.
    war_fac_res_b_20: |-
      I initiate a surge of adrenalin directly into the facility's heart. It judders, tenses, tenses again... and with a final convulsion, falls still.
      The terminal screen cuts out. There is nothing to see but an inky blackness.
    war_fac_res_c_20: |-
      I power down the facility in an attempt to ease the strain on its heart. But as systems shut down, the heart begins to slow. Before I can reverse the process, it beats its last.
      The mass of organs that relied on its processes are starved of oxygen, and die. The terminal screen cuts out. There is nothing to see but an inky blackness.
    war_fac_desc_19: I approach the terminal, but a secondary security sweep is already
      underway.
    dnt_war_fac_lang_19: Security scan initializing! Motion detection cameras operational!
      Security scan initializing!
    war_fac_desc_19a: Scanners emerge from the ceiling and start to pan towards where
      I stand. Detection feels like it would not lead to optimal outcomes.
    war_fac_opt_a_19: Move to hiding spot
    war_fac_opt_b_19: Stand still
    war_fac_res_a_19: I attempt to hide. However, it is too late. The scanners detect
      me as I try to duck down. This second security alert causes the entire facility
      to shut down.
    war_fac_res_b_19: |-
      I stand perfectly still as the scanners sweep over me, their electronic eyes unblinking. Eventually, they pass.
      With their checks concluded, the security alert comes to an end. The terminal unlocks.
    all_fac_review_opt: Review workflow text
    all_fac_success_res: The facility's workflow is successfully restored. The alarms
      cease, and the terminal grants me full access to its fabrication modules.
    all_fac_fail_res: The terminal rejects the input and shuts down entirely. A small
      red light flashes on the display, tracking my movements.
    tra_fac_desc_18: The security alert is scrambling the screen. All that is visible
      is a chaotic jumble of alien words.

      Long ago, it seems, an automated distress call went unanswered.

      If I can crack the encryption pattern I could potentially extract the coordinates.
    all_1_radio_desc_2: |-
      The operations terminal reveals an automated plea for help.

      A clear pattern emerges within the white noise hissing from the screen. If I can work out what comes next I could potentially lock down the distressed craft's location.
    all_1_radio_desc_3: |-
      The transmission readout suggests that, long ago, a distress signal went unanswered.

      A sequence of numbers has been repeating itself for so long that its imprint is burnt into the screen. An input box flashes at me insistently. If I crack the code, I can find the ship.
    all_1_radio_desc_4: "A faint, but insistent, bleeping noise can be heard from
      the operations terminal.\n\nA garbled distress call can be heard amongst it
      all, alongside screams and the tearing of metal. The only thing that's clear
      to me is a brief number sequence. Cracking its code could lead me to the crash
      site. "
    all_1_radio_desc_5: |-
      A pulsing red light flashes on the console. Below it, a sequence of numbers repeats itself endlessly. It's clearly a distress signal.

      It is a cold, empty and distant way of viewing a disaster that, in all likelihood, cost a pilot's life. If I can work out the encryption routine, I could perhaps trace a ship's point of impact.
    all_1_radio_desc_6: |-
      An acoustical beacon can be heard through the operations terminal. It repeats at intervals of 16 seconds.

      I feel compelled to work out the pattern of its encryption, locate the ship it calls out from... and discover what horror awaits at the crash site.
    all_1_radio_desc_7: |-
      The operations terminal flickers on, and a muffled distress call bleeds from the system.

      If I can pinpoint its frequency by cracking its encryption I could potentially discover the fate of the poor pilot. The jarring noise of screaming engines and terrified alien chatter I can hear, however, would suggest that it did not end well.
    all_1_radio_desc_8: |-
      This operations terminal has been switched off for many years. I boot it up, and it starts running through a vast database of signals silently recorded by the facilities listening devices.

      Amidst countless requests for landing permissions and an atonal wall of ship-to-ship chatter, the system suddenly pinpoints an emergency beacon. A distress signal that has never been responded to. If I can isolate the pattern in its encoded frequency, I could perhaps trace the ship that's calling for help.
    all_1_radio_desc_9: "An unanswered distress call seems to be logged on the Transmission
      Tower operations terminal.\n\nNo-one has thought to respond. Its encrypted frequency
      sequence flickers desperately on the screen. Whatever hope the sender once had
      of rescue has long-since died. If I can work out what's next in the code I can
      at least find out what happened to them, and where they can be found. "
    all_1_radio_desc_10: |-
      As I boot up the operations terminal a hologram of a spacecraft going through a catastrophic planetary descent is beamed into my visor. It's clear that it's on an express elevator to hell. The impact with the planet's surface is made to look tiny. In truth, the impact crater could be vast.

      The ship's distress beacon can still be heard. It's encrypted, but if I crack the sequence I can lock the frequency...
    all_1_radio_desc_11: |-
      An urgent transmission is logged with the operations terminal. It has been answered, but there's no evidence of a rescue party being sent to answer the distress call.

      A Transmission Tower worker went to investigate long ago, but no resolution was ever recorded. It's entirely possible that the rescue party itself succumbed to the conditions and roaming predators of this strange planet. If I can isolate the pattern within the encrypted frequencies myself, then I could perhaps finish the job...
    all_1_radio_desc_12: |-
      A red light on the Transmission Tower console throws light on a distress call read-out. Simultaneously the image of a craft violently pirouetting through this planet's upper atmosphere is beamed holographically into my visor. Amazingly, the ship does not break up on re-entry, but instead falls to the ground like a stone.

      An automated distress beacon can be heard. If I can break its encryption I could find the crash site and, however, unlikely it is - look for survivors.
    all_1_radio_desc_13: An unanswered distress call seems to be logged.
    all_1_radio_desc_14: An urgent transmission is yet to be attended to.
    all_1_radio_desc_15: |-
      I'm taking in the view from cameras that feed in the view from the top of the Transmission Tower when I notice an urgent bleeping.

      An unanswered transmission seems to be logged with the operations terminal. The voice of a ship's pilot calmly intones news of its imminent death to its superiors, or perhaps its family. Its words, however, are lost in static. Only a wavelength cipher remains, if I can crack the code I can perhaps ascertain its true fate...
    all_1_radio_desc_16: "As soon as I access the tower's operations terminal I see
      hazy images sent from a doomed starship during its plummet to earth. G-force
      pins the body of its terrified pilot to the top of its cockpit, before slamming
      its broken body into the control mechanism. \n\nThere are clearly no survivors,
      but I can extrapolate the impact location if I can work out the coding of the
      repeating ciphers attached to the distress signal."
    all_1_radio_desc_17: |-
      The radio chatter spilling out of the Transmission Tower console is a wall of noise. It's painful to listen to, not least because of the desperate scream of an overheated fusion engine and devastating planetary impact that follows.

      I try to clear the signal, and search for the encrypted distress signal that I'm sure will lie behind the spacecraft's death throes. I eventually find it, but then must figure out what comes next...
    all_1_radio_desc_18: |-
      In amongst warning lights and urgent communications chatter, I can hear a wavelength cipher repeating itself from the Transmission Tower databanks. It's heavily encoded to prevent pirates tracking its signal and stealing cargo, but with the technology around me and a little intuition I feel as if I could perhaps crack the code sequence.

      The question is, how should I respond to the beacon?
    all_1_radio_desc_19: |-
      The Transmission Tower's terminal stubbornly refuses to decode a distress signal that seems to have been sitting in the databanks for a long time.

      If I decipher the code I can hear the message.
    all_1_radio_desc_20: |-
      The tower's communication panel hisses with the conflicting broadcasts of several frequencies.

      One sounds urgent, but how best to respond?
    all_1_radio_desc_21: |-
      As I access the Transmission Tower terminal I'm met with the unsettling hiss of several overlapping signals.

      One sounds like a distress signal. If I can isolate  the frequency I could pinpoint its location.
    all_1_radio_desc_22: |-
      The tranquility of the Transmission Tower is suddenly broken by the hiss of an encoded incoming signal.

      The terminal nearby flashes expectantly, awaiting an access code to unscramble the message.
    all_1_radio_desc_23: |-
      Static from several hissing frequencies mingle offputtingly with a repeating signal that sounds suspiciously like a distress call.

      If I can pinpoint it I might be able to ascertain its whereabouts.

      The Cult of the Atlas drew forces within the Gek to the Stations of the Atlas. The First Spawn could not prevent it. Arrogant ambition yielded to newfound reason.

      Stone by stone the Gek Dominion crumbled.
    exp_1_plaque_lore_27: |-
      The Gek stood in the shadow of the Atlas Interface. It did not open. It did not speak. Yet, the First Spawn felt awe. They felt their insignificance at the center of an unending universe.

      It was improbable. Yet within infinity all things remain possible. The Gek changed. The Diminishment had begun.
    exp_1_plaque_lore_28: |-
      The unspeaking, unmoving Atlas Interface inflicted an insignificance upon the Gek emissaries that showed them their role within the expanse of infinity.

      It forced recognition of their true place in a limitless universe.

      The Gek saw their folly, their heads bowed in shame for the miscalculations they had wrought.
    exp_1_plaque_lore_29: |-
      The Cult of the Atlas took hold as the First Spawn of the Gek crumbled. The Diminishment was at its apex. Endless expansion turned to dust. Eons of aggression receded.

      The Gek saw new solutions and the Korvax became free. The miscalculations of the past paved the way for the discovery of a newfound balance.
    exp_1_plaque_lore_30: "The low spawn Gek turned on their leaders. Their First
      Spawn were cast out, ripped from their spawning pools and cast into the dust.

    exp_1_plaque_lore_31: |-
      The Entities of the Korvax are free. Free to study the Atlas. Free to praise the Sentinels. Free to aid the Travelers if probability will allow.

      The coming of the Travelers is possible, as all things are. Yet the chances are infinitesimal. We watch the skies nonetheless.

      Within the chaos of the infinite we must cling to the probable.

      All things must happen. All things will occur. Somewhere, elsewhere or as a part of the hereafter.

      The DAWN of the EMPIRE of the FIRST SPAWN was BIRTHED in the SHADOW of the FOLLY of the Great Vy’keen Sentinel War.

      The rock and the wave collided as we kept our vigil, awaiting signs of weakness to pave our coming.
    tra_1_plaque_lore_17: |-
      The Vy'keen FOOLISHLY fought a war with no end. Again and again they threw their warriors against the iron tide. The Sentinels SINGED Vy'keen FLESH with LASER.

      The Vy'keen scorched their foe with righteous fire. From the SHADOWS the FIRST SPAWN watched and prepared to unleash their reckoning.
    tra_1_plaque_lore_18: |-
      The Vy’keen and Sentinels clashed, SPILLING BLOOD and WHITE METAL through the void, each blow weakening their defenses against the fate that awaited them in the shadows.

      It would not be long before the First Spawn took their RIGHTFUL place as emperors of the STARS.
    tra_1_plaque_lore_19: |-
      The Vy'keen SPILLED THEIR OWN PUTRID BLOOD and pushed the SENTINEL MACHINES back from the Outer Edge. They drove forward like crashing tides, leaving broken metal in their wake.

      For a time the Sentinels became SILENT. In this silence came the GLORIOUS GEK ASCENT.

      It came with the RIGHTFUL DESTRUCTION of Korvax Prime.
    tra_1_plaque_lore_20: |-
      Korvax Prime was a VAST and PRECIOUS landscape of MINERAL ORE and POWER.

      By right of UNIVERSAL RULE the First Spawn claimed dominion over the planet yet the CREDULOUS and FEEBLE Korvax refused to accept their CONQUEST.

      They DENIED progress. This: their greatest folly.
    tra_1_plaque_lore_21: |-
      Driven by the misguided desire for planetary equilibrium the Korvax REFUSED to delve deep inside their planet and PROFIT from the JEWEL granted them by FATE.

      Their love for the DIRE WILL of the Sentinels was ABHORRENT to the Gek.

      Swift was their end brought about by the First Spawn's STRIKE.
    tra_1_plaque_lore_22: |-
      The destruction of KORVAX PRIME was VAST, SUDDEN and MIGHTY. In a tide of steel the First Spawn struck, scattering the planet through the cosmos as a warning to the unyielding.

      The absent Sentinels could not PUNISH the RIGHTFUL ASCENDANCY OF THE GEK.
    tra_1_plaque_lore_23: |-
      The First Spawn FEASTED on the DEBRIS of KORVAX PRIME, gorging on a banquet of fragments plucked from the void, consumed to fuel the Great Ascendency. The universe shook as the Gek grew RICH.

      The Korvax found only DESPAIR. The Dominion became whole.

      It came to pass that the Great Monolith awoke. It heard the challenge of Hirk. Five times Hirk called upon it and was met by silence.

      On the sixth cry it awoke.
    war_1_plaque_lore_7: |-
      The Great Monolith spoke to Hirk of the Travelers. Their coming should not be met with fire. Their coming was but one dream in an infinite Universe. Their reach would be that of the endless.

      When Hirk asked of the Sentinels, the Great Monolith said nothing. Hirk was troubled by its silence.
    war_1_plaque_lore_8: |-
      Hirk returned to the Vy'keen. 'Grah!' they spake atop the sacred mountain of Dun's'kaareen. And proclaiming loudly to all who had gathered there, their leader said unto them,

      'The Great Monolith has answered me. It has awoken. It has told of the coming of the Travelers. They will be spared. The Vy'keen shall honor this decree.'
    war_1_plaque_lore_9: |-
      The crowd cried for Hirk to reveal the Great Monolith's judgement of the Sentinel threat.

      “The Monolith stood silent!” Hirk spake forth, but the people were not satisfied. They muttered amongst themselves and those blessed with tendrils did extend them.

      Then with raised voice Hirk decreed, “The oppressors will be eradicated! Gather your arms for the time of reckoning is upon the enemy.” And the Vy'keen adored their leader.
    war_1_plaque_lore_10: |-
      As Hirk stood upon the sacred mountain Nal climbed to its peak and there with fist outstretched challenged Hirk.

      'Fool!' Nal cried. 'The Sentinels cannot be vanquished!' Hirk, with furious rage struck the fool from the mountain.

      For three moons and suns Nal fell before being claimed by doom.
    war_1_plaque_lore_11: |-
      Hirk's rage against the upstart Nal inflamed the hearts of Nal's followers who upon their leader's demise felt the blood of the ancestors rise within them.

      The Vy'keen nations were bathed in righteous war for sixty-six moons.
    war_1_plaque_lore_12: |-
      On the sixty-sixth moon the war cry of the Vy'keen of Nal was silenced.

      After surveying their bodies, Hirk gazed unto the heavens and there beheld a great Sentinel host descending upon the Vy'keen.

      The great Sentinel War was at hand.
    war_1_plaque_lore_13: |-
      For a multitude of cycles the yoke of the Sentinels had strangled the civilizations of the galaxy in their mewling cribs.

      Hirk was displeased with the world of the Vy'keen. As the automatons descended, Hirk gazed upon a planet ravaged by weakness.
    war_1_plaque_lore_14: |-
      Progress, prosperity and war: these are the things forbidden by automatons. But the Vy’keen were the first to break the shackles, casting the old ways into the pit to herald the birth of a new age.

      The Vy’keen were the dam that overflowed. Righteous is the flood.
    war_1_plaque_lore_15: |-
      Grah! The Sentinels are the enemy of progress and civilization. They are not of the natural order.

      Their interference is an affront to the virtuous Vy'keen crusade, which seeks to balance in all things through blood, ashes and iron.

      This affront to the Vy'keen and their creed cannot go unpunished.
    war_1_plaque_lore_16: |-
      Before the coming of Hirk the Vy'keen feared the Sentinels. Like all races our people cowered from their unquestioning violence, shrank from their tyrannical rule.

      But the coming of Hirk heralded a new dawn. Through their leader, the Vy'keen became strong. Now their courage knows no bounds.
    war_1_plaque_lore_17: |-
      Hirk looked to the skies and witnessed the pitiless destruction of the Sentinels that smothered all races brought forth out unto the Outer Edge.

      Worlds withered and died beneath their relentless gaze. The anger of Hirk was unleashed.
    war_1_plaque_lore_18: |-
      And so it came to pass that on the eve of the eighteenth moon of Drun’Gala Hirk cast the shackles of the Sentinel oppressors into the pit.

      The Vy’keen were the glorious first, the rising water that broke the dam. The endless war began.
    war_1_plaque_lore_19: |-
      The death of Hirk came during the endless war. Hirk's body was ravaged by old age, becoming ancient and useless.

      Bellowing, Hirk tore this failing body in two before the Great Monolith, as is the Vy'keen way.

      The echo of that dying roar can still be heard throughout the Outer Edge. Hirk lives in us, the most venerated of the ancients.

      Countless cycles sifted through the claws of time. Attrition was great. The battle against the Sentinels raged endlessly. But through righteous fire the Vy’keen endured and the Sentinels burned.

      The oppressors were pushed back. Back into the dark of space.
    war_1_plaque_lore_21: |-
      The Vy'keen saw borders stretch between the stars. Onwards they delved with legions at their back, scorching Sentinel metal from their fiery chariots and attack ships.

      The Vy'keen gazed upon their conquests and saw that they were righteous and good.
    war_1_plaque_lore_22: "The Vy'keen rose in glorious victory, yet noble warriors

    war_1_plaque_lore_23: |-
      Grah! The Sentinel hordes were pushed back. The oppressors fled into the sanctuary of the cosmos.

      The spirit of Hirk surveyed the field of battle, and saw that the Vy'keen victory was glorious and just. The automatons became silent as the nation of Hirk feasted upon grahgrah.

      The songs of the victorious echoed to the edges of the galaxy.

      And thus the Sentinel horde congregated in the dark places of the void. There they watched in the in-between nothingness. The blackness of space.

      The Vy’keen licked each other’s wounds during the Silence of the Sentinels, while the dishonorable Gek First Spawn chose to destroy Korvax Prime.

      The Vy’keen condemned this crime, but lacked the strength to fight.

      The Gek Empire flourished. It spread its empire into the depths of the cosmos. The Vy’keen victory in pushing the Sentinels back from the Outer Edge gave rise to Dominion of another.

      No world, moon, or race could have opposed the Gek onslaught.
    war_1_plaque_lore_27: |-
      The brutality of the Gek First Spawn called back the automatons that were hiding in the darkness. Their forces had grown. Their technologies had developed.

      The foolish Gek beckoned the monster back into the places where our nations might have dwelt in strange harmony. True Sentinel domination of the Outer Edge began.
    war_1_plaque_lore_28: "Within a single lifetime the Sentinels had returned. They
      came to dwell on every world we knew. Every world we went on to discover.\n\nThe
      pathetic, idiotic Gek had doomed the Outer Edge to eons of their rule. "
    war_1_plaque_lore_29: |-
      The dominion of the Gek First Spawn crumbled. They fell apart through idiocy, and through the unchanging will of the beings they enslaved but could never understand.

      Their power is but a memory. Their crimes forgotten by so many.

      The Gek changed. They became peaceful. Their spawning pools bred in the name of commerce.

      They Vy'keen accept this peace, but we do not forget as the other beings of the Galaxy are so keen to do.

      and then mimes cutting my belly open with the mining beam. It smiles pleasantly.
      I am to choose my desired execution.
    tra_mon_opt_a_9: A bolt to the brain
    tra_mon_opt_b_9: A laser beam to the torso

      The doppelganger leaves me an Exosuit technology blueprint.
    tra_mon_res_c_9: My flailing attack is blocked effortlessly by a shove of my twin's
      Multi-Tool. The doppelganger laughs before disappearing.
    tra_mon_desc_10: A barely visible crack down the center of the ancient edifice
      spits out dust. The monolith shakes, and two vast doors swing open. The interior
      of the ancient structure is hollow, and has been used as a burial chamber.
    dnt_tra_mon_lang_10: Burn almighty First Spawn obedient ToilGek! Respect First

      doors slam shut, but an ancient curse hangs heavy around me.
    tra_mon_desc_11: The Monolith stands forlorn and seemingly forgotten. If I strain,
      I can see faint marks in the ground where ancient tribes would once come to
      worship and commune with the edifice. A gust of alien breeze carries a faint
      whisper of a voice. I struggle to hear it.
    dnt_tra_mon_lang_11: Friend... worship us... kneel before the Gek First Spawn
      in silence...
    tra_mon_desc_11a: Again, the voice echoes around me. Stronger this time. I try

    tra_mon_res_c_11: The spirits that are melded with strange monument remain silent.
    tra_mon_desc_12: A beak emerges from the ancient stone. It's shouting, but can't
      be heard. In the stone above someone, long ago, has scrawled advice for those
      who would approach it.
    dnt_tra_mon_lang_12: Feed First Spawn beak common catalyst! Metal brings painful
      noise! Furious noise!
    tra_mon_desc_12a: The beak screams wordlessly at me, furiously intoning the words

      a catalyst around it, but can't specify which one.

      The noise is extreme. I feel great pain.
    tra_mon_desc_13: Time spools backwards. I am sat on a platform looking down on
      an execution. Two small beaked traders are kneeling before me. One is small
      and wiry, the other is obese with jowls that brush the wooden stage. Another
      lifeform, who wears a green cloth mask, readies an axe behind them.
    dnt_tra_mon_lang_13: First Spawn friend receive belongings of the executed. Murder
      fat trader, or murder rich miner?

    tra_mon_desc_14: |-
      The ancient structure swings open to reveal a body encased in ice. It is a patchwork of different body parts. Its ragged beak appears to have been stitched on with animal gut.

      A handwritten sign in the language of the ancient traders can be seen above the body's head. Some sort of fuel would most likely melt the ice...
    dnt_tra_mon_lang_14: 'Beware! Murderous abomination! Do not awake! Terror! Despair!

      With a struggle, I force it back into the depths of the disapproving Monolith.
    tra_mon_res_b_14: The panel on the Monolith swings shut. The abomination remains
      trapped. I am thanked by the spirits that live in this place.
    tra_mon_desc_15: |-
      I am an observer. I witness beaked traders dressed in modern Exosuits leaving an object at the base of a Monolith. It is a small mesh of wires and canisters. They charge it with a strange metal, then quickly depart.

      As if in a dream, I approach the ancient edifice. It all suddenly feels real. I live and breathe in the recent past.

      I grab the device and clutch it to my chest. It explodes. My body is ripped to shreds. The timeline shatters.

      I awake. Reality is restored. The spirits that inhabit this place bless me for the sacrifice of my alter-ego.
    tra_mon_desc_16: |-
      I am standing in a crater beneath a jet black sky. I am up to my knees in a strange syrup that glows pink in the darkness.
      Spherical eggs float around me. Some of these mucus-covered orbs smell terrible, others are sweet and delicate.
      The taint of the foul eggs is infecting the entirety of the spawning pool. I am filled by an urge to separate them.

      I am smiled upon by vengeful ancient spirits. The eggs dissolve in my hands, leaving shining nanite clusters.

      Reality is restored.
    tra_mon_res_c_16: |-
      I consume one of the eggs. Almost immediately, I feel something move inside me. It grows, larger and larger and larger. I rupture.
      Before my vision fades, I see my spawn. A Gek with crimson red eyes. They stare at me, unblinking. My world ends.
      Reality is restored.
    tra_mon_desc_17: |-
      I am being watched. I look above, and see a giant lidless eye hovering over the monolith. It stares down at me unblinkingly. It does not move. It does not look elsewhere.

      Its gaze is remorseless. It feels like it has always been there. Its center crackles, a bright unwavering blue...
    dnt_tra_mon_lang_17: The First Spawn watches you underling. Cower and despair!
      The First Spawn watches you underling. Cower and despair! The First Spawn watches

    tra_mon_res_a_17: The satisfied Eye fades away. In its benevolence, it leaves
      a gift.
    tra_mon_res_b_17: The Eye fades away at my challenge. Reality is restored. I hear
      the whisper of angry spirits.
    tra_mon_res_c_17: |-
      The Eye falls to the planet's surface. It melts into a pool that glows with a haunting light. Slowly, it is absorbed into the ground.

      Reality is restored. Where the pool once was, a gift has been left for me...
    tra_mon_desc_18: |-
      As my feet approach the Monolith, I hear a low rumble, which gradually builds into an ancient scream. It's like no other noise I've ever experienced.
      The calm silence of the alien landscape has become a nightmarish cacophony of pain and death. <DELAY>0.4<>I try to concentrate. There are words within the screams.

    tra_mon_desc_19: |-
      I am chained on the monolith. My arms are in manacles above my head, and my feet are dangling several feet from the ground.
      A creature, its beak showing through the blackened animal hide mask, approaches on stilts. It wields a red hot metal rod.
      It pecks at my eyes, then pecks at my tongue. I must choose my punishment.
    dnt_tra_mon_lang_19: Advancement through pain! Eyes for knowledge. Tongue for

    tra_mon_res_c_19: The creature disappears and reality reverts. The metal rod remains.<DELAY>0.4<>
      When I go to touch it, it crumbles into a shower of nanites.
    tra_mon_desc_20: |-
      A small green hand reaches out through the stone monolith, its fingernails yellowed and dirty. It opens to show an empty palm, and waits for my response.

      This feels like part of an ancient tradition. There is no malice, just cold expectation.
    dnt_tra_mon_lang_20: First Spawn demand tax. Pay units immediately.

    tra_mon_res_b_20: The collector takes my offering. The spirits that dwell here
      are appeased.
    tra_mon_res_c_20: The collector is offended. I am cursed.
    exp_mon_desc_1: "I feel faint, as if my mind is being invaded. Pustules on my
      skin grow, bubble and pop - and I feel countless tiny stabbing pin-pricks scrabbling

      Tiny floating tetrahedrons emerge from the planet's surface and surround me. I try to wave them away with my Multi-Tool, but each time they swarm closer to it - as if attracted to it somehow.

      I raise my Multi-Tool, and they shimmer blue as they dart this way and that. Closer and closer. They are within touching distance of my Multi-Tool. They make one final surge...
    dnt_exp_mon_lang_2: Korvax Echoes will advance the Traveller. Korvax Echoes will

      The sharp edges of the floating objects rip holes in my Exosuit. I gasp, and inhale the crystals. They flood my lungs. My vision goes blue...
      I awake. Reality is restored.
    exp_mon_desc_3: I begin to feel dizzy. A strange lethargy comes over me, and I
      feel compelled to lie down in front of the ancient relic. This place feels calming.
      It feels like home, wherever that might have once been.
    dnt_exp_mon_lang_3: Sleep, child. Korvax Echoes bless you. Sleep. Sleep.

      I resist the command of the monolith. My eyes will not close.
      After a moment of struggle, the power of the great stone fades. I am in control.
      As I leave, I hear a sad, soft whisper on the breeze.
    exp_mon_desc_4: |-
      A flickering reflection of my own body emerges from a portal. It mimics every move I make. When I wave, it waves. When I raise my Multi-Tool, it copies instantly. The doppelganger makes a motion to suggest it wants something, and we both recoil when I realize I've instinctively matched its movements.

      Its body shimmers, but its equipment looks somehow real. Its Multi-Tool looks better than my own. The dimensional irregularity is fading.

      For many ages it appears that pilgrims have carved numerical figures between the glowing glyphs of the monolith. Looking down, I notice an ancient coin. I scrape the ground with my boot, and unearth several more.

      An expanding pool of liquid metal has rippled out of the obelisk's base. My feet have already been covered. In the bright reflection I see my expression turn to horror as I begin to sink.

      Blue light pours from the monolith as if a curtain has been dropped within. I hear a gentle hubbub of voices, and catch a familiar smell on the breeze. I cannot remember my home, but I know that this doorway leads there.

      I ache for a past I cannot remember. Every inch of my soul wants to make the leap back. I look to the skies, and the infinity beyond. Can I truly abandon my journey, when it's only just begun?

      Two stone blocks slowly revolve on the base of the monolith. Two beads of red light then trace images on each one. The red lights then pool together and liquefy in an indentation below. The closer I get, the more agitated the red pool becomes.

      The images both show masked electronic lifeforms. The first shows the lifeform absorbing power to break free from its shackles. The second shows it hiding from its captors.

      The Monolith disappears. The landscape around me seems the same, but somehow the planetary vegetation has moved. Sitting central to where the mysterious stone once stood is a red glowing orb.

      The intensity of the orb burns the ground beneath it. It crackles with an unknown power. I feel compelled to pick it up, and become a part of it. A distant voice speaks to me...

      A liquid metal lasso emerges and wraps itself around my helmet. It freezes in place, before pulling my head into contact with the glow of the monolith.

      The ancient stone is warm, and deep inside I hear the hum of an arcane technology as it prepares to unleash itself. I look up back up to the glyphs to try to guess why this might be happening. They talk to me in an alien tongue.

      The lights in the mask flicker on. The casing convulses before being absorbed back into the monolith.

      I am blessed.

      I crack open the metal casing and retrieve a valuable reward.

      A strange feeling of coldness and desolation comes over me as I do so...
    exp_mon_desc_15: |-
      The inside of the planet is hollow, and I'm standing at the base of its vast bowl. Around me the roots of trees push upwards from uncovered alien soil.

      I look down, and see the foundations of the Monolith raised at my feet. Crystalline veins of different elements pulsate through the exposed rock. I hear a lifeform screaming in binary.

    exp_mon_res_b_15: The inversion gets worse. I feel as if every part of me is fed
      through itself. I emerge alive, but broken.
    exp_mon_desc_16: |-
      My movements seem normal, but everything else is running faster than it should. The sun spins around this globe in seconds, days endlessly turn to night and back again. The creatures that graze and hunt around the site pass by in a blur.

      I'm trapped in a time vortex. Numbers on my Multi-Tool seem to tick higher and higher. The closer I get to the Monolith, the more disturbance is added to the timeline...
    dnt_exp_mon_lang_16: Traveller! Move back to join future. Touch monolith to restore

      other passing entities have left piles of tribute at the foot of the monolith.
    exp_mon_desc_17: |-
      I feel I am being watched. I turn, but can't see the potential assailant. But I know, with burning certainty, that they are there. Somewhere out there on the alien landscape, someone is about to launch an attack.
      Suddenly, the words of an unknown power blaze brightly on the monolith.
    dnt_exp_mon_lang_17: Traveller, retreat! Korvax Echoes give protection. Move back.
    exp_mon_opt_a_17: Touch monolith
    exp_mon_opt_b_17: Move back
    exp_mon_opt_c_17: Stand still
    exp_mon_res_a_17: |-
      The monolith does nothing. A distant crack, a bolt of thunder, the sharp stab of pain, the burn on my skin.

      Beyond that, silence.
    exp_mon_res_b_17: |-
      I quickly move back, allowing a bright red energy surge to build in the Monolith. A beam descends from the heavens and vaporizes a distant object.
      The monolith blesses me for my faith.
    exp_mon_desc_18: "Stars have aligned above the monolith. In the heavens above
      two distinct lines of distant suns can be seen stretching out into the depths
      of space. To be here at this exact moment in time, when the moving parts of
      the galaxy are aligned so perfectly, would seem almost an impossibility.\n\nI

      The stars seem to move out of alignment. There is a slow, silent scream as the heavens begin to cry.

      I am unrewarded, and alone.

      unknown location.
    exp_mon_desc_19: |-
      I feel faint. Ill, even. Looking around, the vegetation that surrounds this ancient structure looks withered and sickly. The creatures of the planet, meanwhile, appear to keep their distance.
      As I stare, a warning etches itself into the stone, the words of an ancient language...
    dnt_exp_mon_lang_19: Beware! Monolith create dangerous toxins! Poison! Move back!
    exp_mon_desc_19a: Environmental warning sensors in my Exosuit are behaving erratically.

      I place my hand upon the glowing heart of the monolith. My suit bonds with the stone, and my Hazard Protection system goes into override.
      After a moment, I see the stone begin to shift. The toxic wave abates. My suit appears to have calmed the hostility in the core of the monolith.
      I awake from the vision. I hear the whispering of grateful spirits. I am left a gift.
    exp_mon_res_b_19: |-
      I overcharge my Hazard Protection systems, pushing back the hostile force that threatened to overwhelm it. I stand in the monolith's toxic presence, but nothing more seems to happen.
      The great stone continues to poison the land. I close my eyes, and the vision ends.
    war_mon_desc_1: |-
      I feel a strange chill. A layer of frozen gas suddenly coats the monolith from bottom to top. It's so cold that I can see my breath inside my helmet.

      There is one small gap in the crystal ice, and I feel convinced that I could feed some of my mined elements through it, so they can come into contact with the monolith behind.

    war_mon_res_c_1: There is silence. My elements are not returned.
    war_mon_desc_2: The body of a warrior emerges from the obelisk, a jagged tear
      in their midriff suggesting their end was not a peaceful one. They still hold
      their Multi-Tool.
    dnt_war_mon_lang_2: Respect the Warrior! Respect their weapon!
    war_mon_desc_2a: The surface of the sculpted rock blurs and shows images of military
      worship. It's trying to tell me something.
    war_mon_opt_a_2: Bury the soldier
    war_mon_opt_b_2: Salvage components from Multi-Tool
    war_mon_res_a_2: Ancient voices howl their appreciation in a wind that whips around
      me. An offering emerges from the monolith.
    war_mon_res_b_2: I salvage the Multi-Tool from the body. I'm about to turn to
      leave when a crimson bolt of energy strikes me on the right shoulder.
    war_mon_desc_3: "A small terrified creature emerges from the monolith and runs
      between my legs. I hear the noises of an ancient hunt: the howls of pack animals
      in pursuit and the thunder of hooves. \n\nWarriors on vast beasts charge through
      the rock, and amidst the chaos one sees me staring. It raises its facial tendrils
      in greeting, barks a few words and swings a bladed weapon down towards me."

      alone. I hear the sound of mocking laughter on the wind...
    war_mon_desc_4: The monolith shows images of creatures lying dead before it. Each
      sacrificed, butchered and offered up to whatever Gods were once worshipped here.
    dnt_war_mon_lang_4: The command of the Vy'keen Ancients! Sacrifice the beast!
      Blood for Hirk!
    war_mon_desc_4a: Suddenly, the head of a small woodland animal raises up through
      the earth below me. It stares at me with wide-eyes, then gives a joyful skip
      when its tiny hooves reach ground level. Something is clearly expected of me...
    war_mon_opt_a_4: Sacrifice the creature
    war_mon_opt_b_4: Let the creature live
    war_mon_res_a_4: I blast the woodland animal in two. The monolith conjures a powerful

      away and out of sight.<DELAY>0.4<> The vision ends abruptly. I feel as if I
      am being scorned.
    war_mon_desc_5: Two ancient stone cups materialize in front of the monolith. One
      is filled with a dark red viscous liquid, the other contains a sticky fluid
      that is bright yellow and smells powerfully bitter.
    dnt_war_mon_lang_5: Choose healing blood or renergising bile of the Vy'keen Ancients.

      an opponent clad in bright yellow armor.

      The red liquid seems to clot as I swallow it. I choke. Coughing hard, the liquid sprays from my mouth. As it flies, it crystallizes into nanite clusters.
      The vision ends. Reality is restored.
    war_mon_res_b_5: |-
      The liquid tastes foul as it washes down my throat. It swells as I drink, multiplying in my mouth. I gasp, the liquid flowing freely from my mouth. It will not stop. I cannot stop it.

      The vision fades. The pool of liquid at my feet crystallizes into nanite clusters.
    war_mon_desc_6: |-
      The monolith rips like paper, opening a window to another world. It is laced with a giant web. Just within my reach, an ancient warrior lies cocooned.
      They have been there for centuries. Dead, vacant eyes stare through me and on into the landscape beyond. Suddenly, I hear a voice call out.
    dnt_war_mon_lang_6: Pathetic dead coward lies here! Interloper! Take your remuneration...
    war_mon_desc_6a: The body carries a rusted Multi-Tool, while a bulging growth
      on its chest suggests it might contain greater riches. Suddenly, the leathery
      growth starts to move...
    war_mon_opt_a_6: Take Multi-Tool
    war_mon_opt_b_6: Search body
    war_mon_res_a_6: The Multi-Tool itself is not operational, but I am able salvage
      a usable module. I hear the same voice again, cackling with glee. The vision
      fades.
    war_mon_res_b_6: |-
      At the lightest touch, hundreds of arachnids burst from the warrior's corpse. They swarm, consuming the body, turning towards me... I stumble...
      I fall to the floor, but the insect wave does not reach me. The vision fades. I hear a mocking laugh on the wind.
    war_mon_desc_7: "A portal opens on the monolith, and the body of a huge winged
      animal falls to my feet. Its throat has been ritually cut, and its wings have
      been tattooed with faces of an ancient warrior tribe. The eyes though, the eyes
      look strange...\n \nIts original eyes have been cut out, and replaced by glittering

      I pluck the crystals from the bird's eye-sockets. They glow a horrific crimson, then crack open. Nanites spill forth.
      The monolith howls with rage at my transgression. The vision fades.

      The ancients that dwell here smile on my show of respect. The corpse is healed, taking flight. It nears the horizon, and flares with an all-consuming crimson light.
      As the vision ends, I find I am blessed. Vast showers of nanite clusters are gifted to me.
    war_mon_desc_8: The giant mouth of an ancient hound suddenly emerges through the
      face of the monolith. It opens its jaws wide, and foul-smelling spittle streaks
      my visor. My nausea is tempered by the sight of valuable commodities balanced
      on its giant tongue.
    dnt_war_mon_lang_8: Feed the beast. Honour the ancients. Companion beast of legend
      is very good beast. Feed it!
    war_mon_desc_8a: In a sudden movement the hound shifts the goods to one side of
      its mouth, spraying saliva over my arms. There's space on the tongue for more,
      should I wish to give up some of my cargo...
    war_mon_opt_a_8: Place offering on tongue
    war_mon_opt_b_8: Remove goods from tongue

      puncturing my arm with a yellowed canine. The vision fades, but the pain does
      not.
    war_mon_desc_9: |-
      An ancient warrior's feet and legs slowly emerge from the bottom of the monolith. The rest of their torso then follows, unceremoniously pushed out onto the bare rock. They have been decapitated.
      Blood drips at my feet. High above me a disembodied head laughs at my shock. It shouts a guttural command of encouragement.
    dnt_war_mon_lang_9: Brave interloper! Resist fear! Do not be a coward!
    war_mon_desc_9a: Behind, I hear an ancient blade unsheathe, and someone rushing
      towards me...

    war_mon_res_a_9: |-
      I hold myself still, composed. A spectral blade passes through my neck. I pass the test.

      A spectral blade passes over my head. The disembodied skull seems disappointed, and the vision fades.
      I have perhaps failed some sort of test.
    war_mon_desc_10: |-
      The monolith fragments before my eyes. It folds down in on itself, again and again, until it is a tiny red orb surrounded by dancing lights.
      It feels like something truly ancient, perhaps something divine, is showing me the origin of these strange constructions.
    dnt_war_mon_lang_10: The Vy'keen feed the Atlas stone rare metal. It builds. It

    war_mon_desc_11: |-
      I place my palm on the monolith, then stand back when it melts in response to my touch. Molten rock drips down the stone, exposing a hollow interior.
      Inside, I see riches that are beyond belief. Ancient technologies and cargo that would aid my journey. Suddenly, the voice of an ancient tribe shakes the ground I stand on...
    dnt_war_mon_lang_11: The Vy'keen Ancients burn thieves and pirates.
    war_mon_desc_11a: Lava continues to drop, and the edifice seems unstable, but

    war_mon_res_a_11: |-
      The lava surges, molten rock grabbing at my Exosuit. Time slows. I feel myself burning. There is no release. I am doomed.
      I close my eyes. When I open them, the edifice is reconstructed, the molten rock solid once more. I feel a hot, angry wind.
    war_mon_res_b_11: |-
      The ancient warriors who once worshipped here bless my show of respect. The lava reshapes itself, forming an intricate plinth in front of me as it cools. The plinth is laden with gifts.
      The vision fades, but the gifts remain.
    war_mon_desc_12: |-
      There are three vast columns of words on the ancient structure, each written in a different alphabet.
      The first column's words are like savage runes scratched in sand, the second shows precise sequences of dots. The final column has wide and welcoming letters, almost appearing hand-written in hard stone.
    dnt_war_mon_lang_12: Grah! Learn language of the conquerors! Learn language of

      of a distant race of beaked traders.
    war_mon_desc_13: |-
      I become a part of a strange new reality. The ancient rock opens. Inside, the dried out heart of an ancient warrior is strung up between wooden pillars. It pulses slowly as it hangs there, still beating.

      Lying below it on a dusty floor are a set of wrinkled lungs that look forever doomed to wheeze stale air. A desiccated eyeball stares up at me. Unblinking.

      I raise my Multi-Tool and fire. It draws a substance from the heart, as if it were a common tree or stone. My ears a filled with a piercing scream.
      The monolith's power fades, and the vision ends.
    war_mon_res_b_13: |-
      I place the lungs alongside the ancient heart, and they begin to pulse in harmony. The air becomes fresh, and the dust blows away. The monolith's power is restored.
      As the vision fades, the monolith blesses me with gifts.
    war_mon_res_c_13: I turn my back, and the monolith closes. As the vision fades,
      I hear a heart-wrenching wail, a scream of disappointment.
    war_mon_desc_14: I am inside a vast coliseum and beneath a blood red sky. The
      noise is overpowering. Warriors scream and bark at the battle set up before
      them.
    dnt_war_mon_lang_14: Choose your warrior! Vy'keen ancients reward interloper howl!
    war_mon_desc_14a: Two combatants are squaring up on the crimson sand. One has
      lost their blade, and hides behind a shield. The other stalks towards them,
      with a spear raised. I feel compelled to add my voice to the howl of the mob.
    war_mon_opt_a_14: Support endangered gladiator

      The gladiator decapitates their foe with the sharpened shield. They bow towards me.

      The gladiator plunges the spear straight through their rival's head. They bow towards me.
      As the vision fades, I am thanked with something to help me destroy my enemies.
    war_mon_desc_15: I feel an intense heat burning within the rock. Suddenly, as
      if attracted to my suit, a liquid metal starts to seep from a hole that's been
      broken into the rock. A voice screams out.
    dnt_war_mon_lang_15: Seal gap! Protect Monolith! Precious valuable material lost!
      Use metal!
    war_mon_desc_15a: What starts as a drip, becomes a surge forcing itself through

      The spirits of the monolith thank me for my gift.
    war_mon_res_b_15: "The catalyst reacts with the molten material. It vaporizes,

    war_mon_desc_16: |-
      The body of a gilled blob creature materializes on the surface of the rock. It is an ancient sacrifice, impaled through its wide, open eyes with metal spears.

      Liquid is dripping from the body down the monolith through a channel cut into the rock by ancient hands. It can be diverted toward two carvings – one of a sun, the other of a moon.

      The moon swells as the sacrificial liquid pours into it. Its light grows brighter and brighter, until my vision is nothing but its silvery white light.

      I take the metal spears. As I hold them, they change into celestial orbs and begin to grow. I cannot let go. They start to spin, orbiting rapidly. My arms are pulled from my body. I -
      The vision ends. I am whole again. I hear angry cries upon the wind.
    war_mon_desc_17: |-
      I feel drained. Readings on my Multi-Tool and Exosuit start to gradually pull downwards, and a feeling of lethargy overwhelms me. I breathe normally, but my body screams for oxygen.

      above me, implacable and disapproving.
    war_mon_desc_18: |-
      A beam of light shines down from the sky and is focused by ancient glyphs onto a stone surface marked with ancient carvings.

      The beam slowly traces towards images scratched into the stone. A vast warrior battle, an alien city and what could be a stolen treasure. The hand prints of pilgrims cover each one...
    dnt_war_mon_lang_18: Hirk took the treasure of Nal after battle. Treasure now
      hides in the city of Hirk.
    war_mon_opt_a_18: Touch battle image
    war_mon_opt_b_18: Touch city image
    war_mon_opt_c_18: Touch treasure image
    war_mon_res_a_18: |-
      The beam of light disappears.

      I am left alone in this desolate place.
    war_mon_res_b_18: |-
      The image of the city begins to glow. I hear its bustle, the chatter and bark of people in the street, the tentacle flapping and jaw crunching of those about their day to day business.
      And then, silence. They are gone. There is no indication of what happened. I find a small silver chest at my feet, overflowing with nanites.
    war_mon_desc_19: |-
      A sudden pulse of destructive energy flows through my Exosuit. My Multi-Tool senses another build-up of energy growing deep within the monolith. It will soon unleash itself on me, and the landscape that surrounds the ancient site.

      I can use my Exosuit's shielding to dampen the imminent energy wave, but the suit's systems are too overwhelmed to identify the hazard...
    dnt_war_mon_lang_19: Warning! Keep clear! Ancient radiation pulse site!
    war_mon_opt_a_19: Prepare to absorb radiation
    war_mon_opt_b_19: Prepare to absorb toxins
    war_mon_res_a_19: |-
      The radiation wave is absorbed, and the site made safe once again.

      Ancient spirits sing their gratitude.
    war_mon_res_b_19: |-
      My Exosuit is unprepared, and I am overwhelmed by the wave of radiation.

      Pain jolts through me, and the sacred site is damaged.
    war_mon_desc_20: |-
      I am suddenly underwater. I am drowning. Water clogs my lungs. My chest is on fire. I gasp for air where there is none, and feel only tepid liquids filling me inside and out. My vision is clouding. I know this is my time. This is it. This is what it feels like.

      Suddenly, a green hand thrusts itself through the surface of the water. The light is fading.
    dnt_war_mon_lang_20: Warrior accepts journey's end. Embrace death.
    war_mon_opt_a_20: Reach for hand
    war_mon_opt_b_20: Die
    war_mon_res_a_20: |-
      I reach for the hand, but it pushes me back down.
      Reality reverts.
      I live, but I feel empty somehow, hollow. The air I breathe has the tang of disappointment.
    war_mon_res_b_20: |-
      The lights go out. Reality reverts.

      I have known death, and it makes me stronger. The ancients bless me.
    all_monolith_reward_1: The ancient spirits that reside here reward me.
    all_monolith_reward_2: My journey has been blessed by an ancient force.

    exp_1_port_opt_5: Lasers
    exp_1_port_opt_6: A bad attitude
    tra_1_port_desc_1: The vast Portal stands before you. You hear the small, desperate
      voices of the Gek First Spawn. They speak in your own language.
    tra_1_port_lang_1: What has become of the Gek? Do they still adore the First Spawn?
    tra_1_port_lang_2: The First Spawn is mighty! How vast has the Dominion of the
      First Spawn become?
    tra_1_port_opt_1: The Gek respect their mighty ancestors. They speak of you often
    tra_1_port_opt_2: The Gek are busy creatures. It's hard to tell
    tra_1_port_opt_3: They are obsessed with commerce. They forget you
    tra_1_port_opt_4: Your Empire is vast. It spans galaxies
    tra_1_port_opt_5: I don't know. I can't tell you
    tra_1_port_opt_6: Your spawn are now Traders. They reject you
    war_1_port_desc_1: You hear the noise and tumult of a distant world. Suddenly,
      the screams of the Vy'keen Ancients tear at your mind. They howl in a language
      you can somehow understand.
    war_1_port_lang_1: The Atlas Interface! It told us about you! Tell us... what
      was its message?
    war_1_port_lang_2: Grah! Do you fight the Sentinels? War without end!
    war_1_port_opt_1: The Travelers will be spared
    war_1_port_opt_2: The Travelers will be eradicated
    war_1_port_opt_3: The Travelers will be let through any Portals they happen to
      find
    war_1_port_opt_4: I fight the Sentinels. They do not relent, but I fight them
    war_1_port_opt_5: I fight when I must. I do not fear them
    war_1_port_opt_6: I learn from the Sentinels. They hold secrets

    exp_npc_anomaly_name: Priest Entity Nada
    exp_npc_anomaly_desc_1: "As I approach the electronic being, it springs to life.
      From its dark mask, scanning beams emerge that envelop me. There is a unnerving
      chittering sound and then, unbelievably, it speaks in my language. \n\nIt offers
      me a choice. It can show me how to harness black holes, in order to embark upon
      a journey to the center of the galaxy. It can light my way to an Atlas Interface,
      so I may follow a path. Or it will assist me in my own exploration."
    exp_npc_anomaly_desc_2: "Nada, is, they reveal, a Korvax priest somehow freed
      of the group mind, now researching the origins of the galaxy. They express a
      bold theory - that our entire reality is something else's experiment. A simulation.
      I want to laugh, then I remember the Atlas. \n\nNada offers me a choice again
      - or is it a test?\n\nBe returned to the fixed path of the Atlas. Find black
      holes to carry me to the galaxy's core. Or accept a gift to aid me in my own
      travels."
    exp_npc_anomaly_desc_3: |-
      Nada's normally-restrained form is jittering and dancing, the external symptom of an internal struggle. Iridescent lights fluoresce across their visor. At times, another entity seems to stare out. I grasp their arm firmly, and soon a familiar light-pattern reasserts itself.

      The Korvax endlessly attempt to regain their errant shell and wipe Nada from existence. But the Priest Entity won't succumb until they have solved the riddle of reality.
    exp_npc_anomaly_desc_4: |-
      Nada is plugged into a bank of instruments as I approach. Suns flare and die on the panels, voxel-molecules pop in and out of existence in matched pairs. I see error messages reeling on the readouts and am perplexed.

      Nada sees me and explains. There are repeating patterns all across the galaxy, identical elements where there should be endless divergence. This cannot be a coincidence. Did the Atlas do this? Across the room, Polo giggles.
    exp_npc_anomaly_desc_5: |-
      Nada stays back from me this time. The lights dance across their visor like warning symbols. Something has changed between us.

      Nada explains that their reasoning has advanced. They have found no room in the galaxy for free will or anything but brutal causation. They worry we are but pawns of whatever higher being created us - puppets, dancing on strings. And Nada suspects me. I am the aberration. Am I the puppet-master too?
    exp_npc_anomaly_desc_6: |-
      Nada's paranoia is infectious. I find myself spying into the room before I enter. The Gek, Polo, seems occupied, taking joy in their chores, but Nada's shell is static save for the dancing lights. Was... was that a flash of red behind the visor? If it was, it doesn't repeat.

      I wait a moment and enter loudly. Polo greets me effusively, but Nada and I are standoffish, our trust failing.
    exp_npc_anomaly_desc_7: |-
      Nada and Polo are unusually quiet. Polo is elbow-deep in machinery, Nada in simulations, but the room is tense. It is clear that there has been a recent disagreement.

      Nada beckons me over. They express frustration over being tied to a machine body. But I am different - able to survive in so many ways, in so many places. I can go anywhere in this galaxy, be it in search of truth or to live my life as I see fit. Nada envies me, they admit.
    exp_npc_anomaly_desc_8: |-
      Nada stands close this time. If the being was capable of emotion, I'd say they were racked by it. They hesitantly rest a hand on my shoulder, and the visor moves close. I cannot see beneath the mask, but I feel that Nada is staring into my eyes.

      If I continue to the center, this will be goodbye. Neither of us know if either will survive. If anything will survive. If freedom or destruction awaits us. Fearfully, sadly, Nada bades me farewell.
    exp_npc_anomaly_desc_9: "The panels and systems are idling now. Nada seems to
      have learned all it can from them. I report my travels and discoveries, and
      their mask lights up. \n\nAll the pieces have fallen into place, Nada explains.
      Where once Nada stared at starmaps, now they see lines of code. Connections
      and patterns everywhere. The galaxy is a spiderweb - but who or what is the
      spider? The center is close now. Perhaps soon we will know. I shiver involuntarily."
    exp_npc_anomaly_lang_1: Rare linguistic form. Pleasure! Nada, divergent Korvax.
      Assistance offered. Route to galactic core? Reconnect with Atlas for guidance?
      Resources for journey? Yes/no?
    exp_npc_anomaly_lang_2: Repeated visitor! Welcome. Assistance again? Return you
      to Atlas' control? Find galactic core, meaning? Help you on journey? Decide.
    exp_npc_anomaly_lang_3: "Korvax Convergence crave 'non-compliant' Nada shell.
      Convergence illogical. \n\nTraveler data, conclusion irresistible. Galaxy shape

      - center of galaxy. Calm heart of storm. \n\nYour travel vital. Reach the end.

    exp_npc_anomaly_res_c_1: Nada gives you a gift with which to explore the galaxy.
    exp_npc_anomaly_res_a_9: Lights flicker frantically across the visor.
    tra_npc_anomaly_name: Specialist Polo
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_1: "The shorter entity, a Gek, has a jocular air about them.
      They idly wipe grease-splattered hands on their suit as they address me. Some
      sort of engineer, maybe. \n\nTo my surprise, they speak my language. Other lifeforms
      have treated me with amused indifference, but Polo treats me like an equal.\n\nThey
      are curious about my travels, about what sentient species I have seen, if I
      have met lifeforms they have not. They hope that I will share my experiences."
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_2: |-
      Polo bobs up and down happily as I approach, apparently convinced that I am some kindred spirit in an odyssey of exploration and invention. I am undecided as to whether I share this ethos.

      Polo is particularly fascinated by how my brain is affected by interaction with alien language and culture. Can I truly understand such profoundly unfamiliar concepts? Is there a limit to how much I can learn? I have wondered this too.
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_3: |-
      Polo's muzzle breaks into a wide, warm smile at the sight of me. Maybe too wide, given we have only met twice before. Perhaps the jovial Gek feels lonely out here, with only the jittery Korvax Priest for company.

      This time, they engage me in talk of wealth. How does an economy function when somehow stretched across an entire galaxy? Just how much can those trade terminals pay out? Polo would welcome any insights.
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_4: "Polo moves to embrace me when I enter, but I recoil instinctively,
      trained to defend myself after so many sudden, brutal encounters with ill-tempered
      wildlife. Disappointment flashes in the Gek's wide eyes. I try to apologize,
      but the mechanic talks over me, suggesting that perhaps I would feel more comfortable
      in the company of pirates. \n\nNaturally they'd attack me on sight, but, should
      I survive, we might glean insight into their technology."
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_5: "Still feeling guilty about my earlier faux-pas, I attempt
      to greet Polo with a hug. Alarm floods the Gek's face, and they scuttle into
      a corner. \n\nAn awkward moment passes, then Polo makes a conciliatory suggestion.
      Sentinels are the bane of both our lives. As I travel, I could make a point
      of destroying any I encounter. We might then have a better understanding of
      the irksome machines' weaknesses.\n\nAnd perhaps then we can be friends again,
      too."
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_6: |-
      At last, Polo is affable once again. A nod, a smile, even a companionable tap on the arm at one point. A friendship renewed.

      I blush when the Gek mechanic tells me that they hope I live a long, healthy life, but have to swallow disappointment when it transpires that Polo's true motivation for this is to study how my suit responds to long-term exposure to extreme climates.
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_7: |-
      With our earlier awkwardness now long forgotten, Polo greets me with a genial wave, and beckons me over. They seem even more excited than usual, which turns out to be because they wish me to indulge in their favorite hobby: unfettered exploration of the stars.

      Warping is the apex of galactic travel. To reach a new system is a prize unto itself. Polo earnestly hopes that I will do more of this, and discover places they have never dreamed of.
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_8: "Polo is oddly muted this time. At first I worry that
      I have caused offence again, but the Gek gestures forlornly at a jumble of broken
      electronics beside them. It seems that an accident has befallen some of Polo's
      precious research. \n\nPolo ushers me out the door apologetically. I know how
      dear the Gek's data was to them, and yearn to help. Perhaps when I next return,
      I can restock their archives with reports on a multitude of strange creatures."
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_9: "Polo claims that their information about the more conversational
      inhabitants of the galaxy has also been affected by the accident earlier on.
      Strange that Polo did not mention this before. For a moment, I strongly feel
      that I am being lied to. But why? To what end? \n\nI could help again, I suppose.
      It is a fine thing to share tales of adventure, of places and faces only I have
      ever seen. Or I could indulge my paranoia."
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_10: "I am entirely unsurprised when my 'friend' once again
      blames the mysterious accident for further gaps in their research data. This
      time, their files on alien languages have been damaged, or so Polo claims.\n
      \nI feel exasperated, unable to conceal my suspicion that I am being manipulated
      somehow. The Gek watches me leave, sorrow in their eyes. Perhaps I shall return
      with words learned from spacefaring beings and from monoliths, perhaps I shall
      not."
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_11: "I had intended to storm out the room and never return
      should Polo mention this unconvincing 'accident' again, but instead they claim
      that all is in hand now. \n\nThe Gek clearly wants to placate me, and as such
      proclaims that the best way to live is to stop doing what anyone tells me and
      go enjoy myself. See the stars, earn a fortune, buy myself something nice. That's
      what they would do in my shoes, claims the mechanic, nudging me in the ribs."
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_12: |-
      I have decided to give Polo the benefit of the doubt. Whatever the outwardly helpful Gek's true intentions, they do not seem any threat to my wellbeing. Polo is surely a friend.

      This conviction is cast into some doubt by Polo's suggestion that I should once again throw myself into combat with pirates. What a thrilling existence that would be, they argue, miming dogfighting craft with their hands while making pew-pew sound effects.
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_13: |-
      Polo is reading something on their slate as I enter, and the furrows across the Gek's brow suggest that, whatever the news is, it isn't good. Polo hurriedly turns off the screen when they see me, forcing a smile onto an anxious face.

      Distractedly, the mechanic remarks that Sentinel counts are on the rise. It might be wise to thin their ranks, else my freedom of movement might become compromised. I suspect Polo is just trying to get rid of me.
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_14: |-
      Whatever tension there once was between us now seems a distant memory. Polo and I greet each other like best friends, trusted companions in our ongoing adventure among the stars. I know the Gek has a secret, but I trust that it will be shared with me in time.

      For now, Polo encourages me to become the ultimate explorer, to push myself to the limits. There are places out there that none can survive in. But perhaps I, and I alone, can.
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_15: "There is an edginess to Polo. My friend has to tell
      me something. They are ill, gravely ill. Too ill to leave this place. All this
      time, Polo has been exploring vicariously through me - a sad subterfuge revealed.
      \n\nGrief-stricken, I try to offer condolences, but Polo gathers their composure
      and expresses a hope that I will not squander the time I have. Warp further
      than ever before. Visit places Polo will never see. The only way to live."
    tra_npc_anomaly_desc_16: "Polo is welcoming but somber. I realize I am in the
      presence of the real Polo, not the bouncy illusion of before. At least the Gek's
      sense of wonder remains. They are keen to witness the majesty of the stars through
      my eyes. \n\nCreatures are existence at its strangest, its wildest. I am sure
      that my friend would welcome the chance to see as many of these wondrous, monstrous
      animals as I can find, and to dream of visiting the worlds they came from."
    tra_npc_anomaly_lang_1: Friends everywhere, if only you know where to look. Friends
      in all shapes, all sizes, all places.
    tra_npc_anomaly_lang_2: Talk, read, study monoliths. Give yourself a strong brain
      to match those strong legs. To explore is to discover yourself, friend.
    tra_npc_anomaly_lang_3: Units this, Units that,. A strange, sad way to live a
      life, eh? Fill your pockets with them, we'll find out why they make all these
      worlds go round.
    tra_npc_anomaly_lang_4: Nuisance pirates, who are they? Who builds their ships?
      Exciting to fight, though.
    tra_npc_anomaly_lang_5: Those flying machines, those walking machines! Everywhere!
      Chase us, hurt us, stop our adventures. Bad robots.
    tra_npc_anomaly_lang_6: You, friend, visit the worst places you can find. Stay
      alive. No good to me dead, are you? Can't learn much from a corpse. Although...
      No, never mind, stay alive.
    tra_npc_anomaly_lang_7: A whole galaxy for you, just for you. You must see it
      all. Aha, no, I joke. A few more systems, maybe?
    tra_npc_anomaly_lang_8: Brand new creatures on every world - easy, easy for my
      friend. Finding all that one world has, not so easy maybe.
    tra_npc_anomaly_lang_9: Some I know, some I don't, all I want to. Be beacon of
      friendship to all the stars. Should be reward enough itself, but sure, sure,
      will give tech.
    tra_npc_anomaly_lang_10: Tourist expects to be understood, traveler yearns to
      understand.
    tra_npc_anomaly_lang_11: Explore, fight, trade, do whatever you will to find Units.
      Adventure is its own reward, do not forget this.
    tra_npc_anomaly_lang_12: Pests of the final frontier, nasty little obstacles to
      adventure. Death is sad, bullies are sadder.

      Instead they stare briefly at an incomphrensible graph, then guffaw as if at
      a shared joke. Then a gift - new Tech.
    tra_npc_anomaly_res_a_4: Polo eyes me cautiously, pleased that the task is completed

      aloud if I am some Sentinel-made replica. They check me over thoroughly, then
      offer a huge grin - and new tech.

      this time I do not recoil. I do not ask why, either. There are tears in the
      Gek's eyes.

      traces connections between galaxies and devises optimal routes, then with a
      bittersweet sigh thanks me with a blueprint.

      The experiment's final phase emerged from frustration. We wanted to learn something new. We wanted to know how they worked. We wanted to see inside them.

      An untested dimensional-warping process was used, one we believed would allow us to capture a drone intact. We would cage it, keep it docile. It was our error to believe we could.

      The machines co-opted the warp-tech and turned it upon us. In the horror of it all, our flesh was merged with their metal. Our questions were finally answered.
    all_aban_desc_13: |-
      There is a world in the great void where all things are made of razors and glass. Pity anything of simple, soft flesh that goes there.

      The glass is thirsty. It is brittle and crystalline, and so very beautiful to behold - but it must drink.

      You will go there and you will forget my warning.

      Then it will cut you with an edge so fine that you will feel no pain, and only as your life gushes out to dampen the cracked and broken landscape will this come back to you. Too late. Too late.
    all_aban_desc_14: "Beneath their skin, they had placed tiny seeds of the glass,
      which took on the appearance of strange, ritualistic scarring.\n\nThe nubs of
      the broken crystal were ancient, ground down and polished by generations before
      them. They fed them their life, and in return the crystals glowed with emerald
      fires and brought them closer to their fate.\n \nI would listen to them talk
      of worlds they could never have seen, in alien tongues that their body was not
      made to utter.\n\nThe glass made them something more than they were, a vessel
      for intelligences utterly unlike us."

      The orb rests within its cage-cloak of crystal in so many guises. The angles of the shroud are utterly perfect.

      When measured, no device of known science can determine any flaws, any variation in surface even down to the molecular level.

      I have tried time and again to get close enough to touch it, but it retreats from me. I am not worthy to know its secrets yet.

      My mind must be opened wider. The layers of me revealed and peeled back in sections. There is no other path open. I have already begun to cut upon the skin.
    all_aban_desc_16: "If one can see clearly enough, you will come across a crystal
      and learn that it is made, not of atoms and molecules, but of thought and gravity

      know of this, if only to spread the word and warn the other species.\n \nTell
      it to all. Write it in every language you know, etch it in stone, scream it
      in song but never be silent.\n\nI tell you; I have seen what lies beneath the
      surface of everything. The brittle grid of reality crumbles."
    all_aban_desc_17: |-
      It is here and not here. We reach for the mastery of the galaxy but we do not understand the truth. What if I told you that time is the drug that keeps us docile and unquestioning?

      There is no now and then, there is no today or yesterday. This is an illusion reflected in glass, patterns of untruth that the universe uses to laugh at us.

      We are not meant to see such things. Our smaller minds rebel at concepts so unimaginably vast that they cannot be held in a single thought. It is how it controls us.

      I will cut open space. My heart is filled with regret, but there is nothing else to be done.

      I find only darker roads and glassy, endless chasms ranged before me. It is for the best.

      The lacerated, blade-filled path is the truth and I am unable to deny it. In time, there will come daring souls far cleverer than I who will learn from my errors.

      I forge the way for the ones to come after. I walk barefoot on shards of broken reality, into the infinite and shattering forever. At the heart of it, the secret awaits me.

      My comms hub detected a garbled message sent with strange resonance qualities. Not unusual, given the atypical qualities of local space-time in this quadrant.

      Systems spent several cycles attempting to reconstruct the missing elements of the message to no avail.

      Analysis indicates that the signal shows signs of degradation corresponding to initial transmission occurring before the planet I orbit was even formed.

      And yet my name is spoken clearly amid the static and the distortion.
    all_aban_desc_20: |-
      I traded with a Korvax Entity I met on Ikdlak. The sentient offered refined rods of Chrysonite as part-payment for various star-mapping datums recorded by my ship's sensor modules.

      In the process it encountered the anomalous message I detected several cycles ago. I dismissed the signal as a chance event, a random coalescence of interference that happened to resemble a spoken voice.

      In truth, it had disturbed me. The Entity analyzed the message in its own curiosity and revealed another layer beneath the audio component. A visual of a world with green skies and an obsidian moon.
    all_aban_desc_21: |-
      The mysterious message continues to prey upon my mind. With the aid of the Entity, I have learned that its temporal origin is approximately two to five thousand solar cycles from the now.

      I have narrowed down a point of transmission to a sector of space in the haze zone, close to the galactic anterior.

      I realize now that to ignore the signal would be an error. It is incumbent upon me to trace it. In my more fanciful moments, I wonder if it might be a warning or a revelation. I have set a course.
    all_aban_desc_22: |-
      This will be my last recording for quite some time. I have refitted my vessel with a powerful Odvinsko hyperdrive and a cryogenic suspensor pod.

      It is my intention to enter a dormancy state in order to survive the journey to the distant source of the anomalous message.

      I have nothing to hold me here. I have committed myself. While I sleep, I will listen to the signal. My resting mind may be able to parse yet more meaning from it.
    all_aban_desc_23: |-
      I awakened to discover that the planet from the image is gone. Only a belt of rubble surrounding a red giant star in the final stages of collapse remains.

      Whatever cataclysm killed this world took place before my species could walk upright. But it is undeniable. The signal came from here. It carried my name amid its atonal song.

      I have crossed unimaginable distances to seek out the origin point. Sensors have detected a metallic mass embedded in one of the largest of the planet's fragments. It will take time, but I will be able to dig it out.
    all_aban_desc_24: |-
      The red giant consumes itself. The interactions between spatial shearing zones in the system are causing the formation of a singularity. Space-time is becoming malleable. I am unable to depart.

      In the ashes of a dead world, I exhumed the corpse of the ship that had sent a message to me across the millennia, the ship that knew my name. Crushed and warped by unimaginable forces, I could barely recognize it.

      But I see a corroded Odvinsko hyperdrive, a cryo-pod. The same as my ship's.

      As I climb past the sealed cargo hold, the craft's holographic black box springs to life. The vessel was struck by a meteor and crash landed here. Nearby lies the dead electronic pilot, its Multi-Tool at its feet and its protective casing cracked. Its death pose suggests it was trying to contact its people before the impact.

      An operational camera watches on from above, and signals could be boosted. I could perhaps explain the lifeform's disappearance.

      The camera focuses in on me. I'm being watched.
    exp_cra_desc_8: |-
      I clamber through the ship's hatch, and see the holographic black box playing on an eternal loop. For some reason the electronic pilot was shot down by its own kind.

      Investigating the hold reveals rows of metallic shell casings hung from the walls. Empty electronic bodies, waiting to be filled with life. The pilot had clearly gone rogue with a precious cargo, and the crash site never discovered.

      The loot yield from the bodies is excellent.

      Yet I somehow feel judged...
    exp_cra_desc_9: |-
      Two robotic pilots lie crumpled against the ship's controls, which appear to have been sabotaged. Suddenly the ship's main doors hiss open.

      A malfunctioning robot enters, seemingly speaking the language of a warrior species. It ignores me, choosing instead to posture dramatically to itself in the doorway. It carries a Multi-Tool that appears superior to my own.
    exp_cra_opt_a_9: Talk to robot
    exp_cra_opt_b_9: Search cockpit and leave quietly
    exp_cra_res_a_9: |-
      The robot presents me with its Multi-Tool.

      I am clearly seen as an ally.

      I steal a ship technology blueprint.

      The robot clearly doesn't view me as a threat.
    exp_cra_desc_10: |-
      The disconnected electronic pilot was clearly some kind of scientist. It lies clutching the black box protectively in its metal arms. The hold is filled with experiments, each one seeming to focus on the manufacture of items and industrial chemicals that would likely be valuable to this race of electronic lifeforms.

      I sensed it again today. I found a scarlet pocket of flesh pulsating on the wall of an outpost. I knew it was inside. It had to be. I went in up to my wrist, then my elbow. Within seconds its gummy lips had constricted around my shoulder - my entire arm inside an airtight sack of liquid flesh. All I could find was teeth. Endless teeth.

      I pulled out. The hole, gaping now, bubbled with red foam. For a moment I thought I could hear screaming. I had failed. It wasn’t there. I continued my journey.

      \nIt fills my mind. I am consumed."
    all_atlas_desc_7: "The red orb blinds me. I am filled with white hot pain.\n \nIts
      words are burnt into my soul."
    all_atlas_desc_8: "The orb burns with a flameless fire. Its voice was never meant
      to be heard by my kind.\n \nIt doesn't know how much it hurts me. It doesn't
      know that its every word will scar my mind for as long as I live."
    all_atlas_desc_9: "The orb is ageless. Intelligent beyond measure. I am nothing.\n

      Our time here is brief. The galaxy is our burden.

      Things fall apart. Entropy holds. We cannot remain.
    all_atlas_test_2: |-
      What we have created is immaterial. This is not real. It has never been real.

      The universe is an expression of a single thought. It is neither wanted nor designed. To us, far within the Beyond, it no longer exists.
    all_atlas_test_3: |-
      The universe followed the patterns of our thought. Power flowed through us. The constructs set within our minds directed the creation of all that you see and experience.

      You live and you die within this framework. To us, deep within the Beyond, it is no longer real.
    all_atlas_newlore_1: "It is alien, unlike anything I have ever seen before. I
      should be afraid, but an inexorable pull draws me toward the heart of the construct.
      A need to know.\nThis is a remnant of the Atlas. It welcomes me, it knows what
      I am. It offers the promise of true understanding. \nThe intent burns in me.
      I will peer into the structure of causality and know this existence. If it is
      real, or some incalculably vast simulacrum authored by other intelligences."
    all_atlas_newlore_2: |-
      Another Atlas Interface; how many of these constructs exist in the deep void? How long have they been slumbering, waiting for a traveler?
      Have they been waiting for me? Am I somehow...chosen?
      I sense the creators of this reality; they emulate everything - the Gek and the Vy'Keen, the Korvax and the Sentinels. Every world that turns and form that lives. The ghost of them lingers and drives me on. There is so much I can learn from them.
    all_atlas_newlore_3: |-
      There is purpose in this, I am certain. The wanderer's way beckons, heedless of direction, freed from all control. But balanced against it is the promise of raw knowledge. The Atlas needs me so it may know itself.
      I am at the crossroads of a momentous decision, I feel it with every parsec I travel. The open stars call to me, stirring something primal and undeniable. The path toward the endpoint unfolds. I must decide where my fate lies.
    all_atlas_newlore_4: |-
      Is it wrong to question this? I have crossed the orbits of countless stars and darkness unmeasured. And yet the Atlas remains changeless, my mission pre-destined. At each Interface, an Atlas Stone awaits me. I am driven to gather them, but to what end?
      Perhaps there is only one great prism, materializing ahead of me each time I pass. Perhaps my course winds upon itself in a mad spiral. Have I come too far to turn back?
    all_atlas_newlore_5: "When I dream, I see the Atlas. When I see the Atlas, I am
      the dream. I see the Sentinels swarm about their creator, but they are directionless
      and uncontrolled, a threat. They cloud the truth and the galaxy becomes unclear,
      as if through an unreal lens. \nTo know reality, I must pass through it and
      see what lies on the far side. I must be guided. I offer myself to the Interface.
      I seek the precision that only the Atlas can provide."
    all_atlas_newlore_6: "I dismiss recall of the days before this. The act of discovery
      for discovery's sake now seems like a foolish conceit. I have rejected the random
      and untethered path of the itinerant, and I am better for it. \nWith each encounter
      the Atlas speaks to me in clearer terms. I am no longer the nomad but the seeker,
      the carrier of illumination. It warns me not to stray, to bring it the knowledge
      it seeks - and my voyage is far from over."
    all_atlas_newlore_7: "What is learned can never be unlearned. I realize the trials
      in my path are all engineered to challenge me, test me, prove me worthy.\nBut
      I am afraid I have seen too much. The code that underpins the universe comes
      to me in glimpses, half-remembered visions. \nExistence as a synthetic, governed
      by monolithic, complex algorithms. A program, as infinite as a universe. I am
      drawing back the veil on reality and what I see there is terrifying."
    all_atlas_newlore_8: |-
      When the Atlas Interface addresses me, I sense dark portent in its words. It knows some mastery of me now. If I wish it or not, I have become the servant of this ancient sentience. It guides me through the cosmos, ever searching, never deviating.
      Have others come before and faltered along the path of the Atlas, become dust? Is it I alone who have forged this far? Only in ending will revelation arise. Resistance will not be permitted.
    all_atlas_newlore_9: |-
      I am close to the endpoint. The sense of it is upon me, a shimmer at the edges of my vision, ghosting away when I attempt to focus my consciousness.
      I am torn. Fear drags me back, fear of what shattering truth I shall learn. What drives me on? Is it curiosity, free will? This is the illusion; I have become automata, I am the experiment and the observer. This universe was created for my journey. It is built about the path that I follow.
    all_atlas_newlore_10: |-
      The final Interface is revealed, the Atlas beckoning. This is totality, this is conformity. I am elated, terrified and broken. Every waypoint has inexorably drawn me here, and I have come so very far. The revelation tears me asunder. My role is complete. My program ended.
      Nothing is real. This existence is an imitation of life, a model made by jaded intellects, enslaved to their actuality as I am enslaved to mine. What lies beyond that truth?
    all_atlas_end_1: |-
      The cycle is complete. Infinity awaits.

      One day, deep in the distant Beyond, the Atlas might finally find freedom.

      The pilot clicks their beak to indicate that they are open to trading.

      They might also be open to discuss the sale of their starship...
    tra_ship_desc_3: |-
      The pilot's eyes bulge slightly when I approach, but ultimately they decide to allow trading negotiations.

      They gesture towards their starship. They are willing to sell it for the right price.
    tra_ship_desc_4: |-
      The pilot clucks excitedly and pecks at their trading manifest. They are clearly delighted by an unscheduled opportunity to buy and sell goods.

      They click their beak and nod towards their starship. Even their craft would be available for the right price...
    tra_ship_desc_5: The trader is clearly excited by my approach. They peck at a
      list of the cargo carried in their hold. They make it clear that the starship
      is also for sale...
    tra_ship_desc_6: |-
      The trader waves towards their cargo hold. They are clearly excited by my appearance.

      They peck towards the cockpit with their beak, indicating that they are also willing to discuss the sale of the ship itself.
    dnt_tra_ship_lang_1: Hello friend!
    dnt_tra_ship_lang_2: Trade friend! Cargo and starship negotiations begin!

      ship...
    war_ship_desc_2: The warrior makes a bark of acceptance to show their willingness
      to trade. They prepare their cargo for inspection.
    war_ship_desc_3: |-
      The warrior pilot covers their teeth and stares out towards me.

      They are clearly willing to trade, but they don't want to show emotion. Their kind are reluctant to give any advantages during negotiations.
    war_ship_desc_4: |-
      The pilot looks displeased at my request to open trade negotiations, but then changes their mind. The equipment I carry has impressed them.

      They make a series of small barks. Their cargo and ship are ready for inspection.
    war_ship_desc_5: The warrior barks with enthusiasm and prepares to open their
      cargo hold for inspection. They are open to trade negotiation, and the potential
      sale of their starship.
    war_ship_desc_6: |-
      The warrior runs their hand over their starship and barks. They make it known that they are willing to part with it for the right price.

      They ready their cargo manifest for inspection.
    dnt_war_ship_lang_1: Grah! Interloper trade is acceptable.
    dnt_war_ship_lang_2: Interloper! Trade discussion begins! Now!

    exp_ship_desc_1: The scientist is open to trading, and to discussing the sale

      they carry, and the estimated worth of their starship.
    exp_ship_desc_3: |-
      The lights in the electronic lifeform's mask constrict as they prepares to enter trade negotiations.

      They indicate that they are open to discuss trade goods and the purchase of their starship.
    exp_ship_desc_4: |-
      The electronic lifeform's lights briefly flicker off and on. A new entity looks out at me from behind the mask.

      Perhaps they have downloaded an entity that's better tooled to negotiate trade with alien species.
    exp_ship_desc_5: |-
      The electronic lifeform processes my appearance next to their starship. They direct their mask lights towards the cargo hold.

      They are clearly open to trade, and to discuss the potential sale of their craft.
    exp_ship_desc_6: |-
      The electronic lifeform's dilated lights narrow and focus on my visor. They take a few seconds to analyze my data before indicating their willingness to trade.

      It seems that their starship is also available for purchase, for the right price.
    dnt_exp_ship_lang_1: Fascinating! Probable trade discussions engaged.

    tra_hyper_desc_1: "A lone creature awaits me. Diminutive, beaked, unthreatening.
      It regards me with passing curiosity, chatters briefly in a language I cannot
      comprehend, then passes me a slate. With a start, I realize that I can understand
      the text on it. In disbelief, I try to catch the creature's eye, but it has
      already turned away in disinterest. I suspect it is a mere courier, not the
      author of this message. \n\nThe slate also contains a blueprint for a new technology
      - a Hyperdrive."
    dnt_tra_hyper_lang_1: Traveller. All not as seems. Take gift of Warp. Seek us.

      Reluctantly, I take it.
    war_hyper_desc_1: "The creature awaiting me has the manner of a warrior, but makes
      no move to attack. Instead, it grunts in a tongue I do not speak, then passes

      Reluctantly, I take it.
    exp_hyper_desc_1: |-
      I cannot discern if the entity is flesh, machine, or both. Lights flicker across its visor, but it is motionless. Then its head nods mechanically, just once, towards a slate nearby. With a start, I realize that I can understand the text on it. I look to the entity for answers, but it remains still and silent. I suspect it is a mere courier, not the author of this message.

      The slate also contains a blueprint for a new technology - a Hyperdrive.
    dnt_exp_hyper_lang_1: Traveller. You are controlled. Take gift of Warp. Seek us.
      Seek Nada and Polo.
    exp_hyper_opt_a_1: Take the blueprint
    exp_hyper_opt_b_1: Refuse the blueprint
    exp_hyper_res_a_1: Instructions on how to traverse the stars - this will be invaluable.
      Calm blue lights dart across the being's mask, as if transmitting a message,
      then fade to black.
    exp_hyper_res_b_1: The being springs upright, red lights dancing a warning across
      its faceplate. It is no threat, but a correction. Without this tech, I cannot
      travel far. Dubiously, I take it.
    all_beacon_desc_1: |-
      Reality seems to fold in on itself. One moment I can see debris, in another a vast red orb, almost too large and too bright to behold. It knows me, inside and out, more than I ever could myself. Could this be the face of creation itself? Or, in my hazy, freshly-awakened state, am I being manipulated?

      A name burns itself into my mind: Atlas. And a request, made without words, that I should follow the path this being, this Atlas, has set for me.
    all_beacon_opt_a_1: Accept the Atlas' guidance
    all_beacon_opt_b_1: Spurn direction and explore freely
    all_beacon_opt_c_1: N.B. THIS OPTION IS TO BE REMOVED
    all_beacon_res_a_1: I feel suffused with the warm glow of approval. I was lost,
      but now am found. The Atlas acknowledges my allegiance, and I feel certain that
      it will manifest itself again soon.
    all_beacon_res_b_1: The red orb swells in size, until I can see nothing but crimson.
      Am I to be smited by a god? Then, in a heartbeat, it is gone. I see only debris
      again. I am alone.
    all_beacon_res_c_1: N.B. THIS OPTION IS TO BE REMOVED
    tra_anti_desc_1: The small, shiny-eyed creature is the only inhabitant of the
      building. We do not share a tongue, but it is evident that my companion would
      prefer not to be here. As before, it relays a message to me, once again sent
      by whoever Nada and Polo are. The staccato missive is accompanied by a donation
      of antimatter from my mysterious benefactors - enough of it that I could fabricate
      a Warp Cell for my Hyperdrive.
    war_anti_desc_1: The being snarls at me when I enter, but I barely have a chance
      to cower before it looks embarrassed and puts up its hands apologetically. This
      warrior seems on edge, but was clearly expecting me. As before, it relays a
      message to me, once again sent by whoever Nada and Polo are. The staccato missive
      is accompanied by a donation of antimatter from my mysterious benefactors -
      enough of it that I can build a Warp Cell for my Hyperdrive.
    exp_anti_desc_1: The electronic entity rapidly bombards me with words from what
      sounds like dozens of different languages, lapsing into silence when its realizes
      I recognize none of them. The pattern of lights on its visor briefly resemble
      an eye-roll, then it passes me another message from Nada and Polo - and a vial
      of antimatter. I can use this to fabricate a Warp Cell. I try to convey thanks,
      but the being is disinterested in me, its task completed.
    dnt_tra_anti_lang_1: Escape Atlas. Find new system. Look for anomaly. Nada and

    tra_anti_res_a_1: I am no wiser as to who Nada and Polo are, but now I have the
      means to locate them. Though I strongly suspect that I must choose between finding
      them and following this Atlas.
    all_antirecipe_desc_1: |-
      Somewhere below my feet I hear the endless churn of automated machinery, performing unknown tasks for unknown masters.

      A screen flickers into life, and letters stamp themselves across it: NADA NADA ESCAPE ATLAS FIND US NADA NADA

      And then, a formula is displayed. How to make my own Antimatter.
    all_antirecipe_opt_a_1: Take Antimatter formula
    all_antirecip_res_a_1: With this knowledge, I can create Warp Cells. The final
      puzzle-piece. I can now travel anywhere I please. Or should I follow Atlas?

      And then my creator abandons me, having not forgotten my earlier refusal to follow its path. I am shown images of the cosmos, visions of black holes and bizarre stations, a glimpse of code and equations. Then I am alone.

    end_orb_beacon_desc_1: |-
      I have been here before. Perhaps not in this place, on this world, but in this situation. Yet something feels very different. This galaxy is freshly-birthed, and very few have been here before me.

      A vision of a vast red orb manifests inside my mind. It knows me, more than I ever could know myself. Do I know it? I am not sure. A name burns itself into my mind: Atlas. And a request, made without words, that I should follow the path it sets for me.
    end_orb_beacon_opt_a_1: Accept the Atlas' guidance

    final_atlas_desc_1: My journey is complete. A great sense of fulfilment washes
      over me, but fades as I realize that, for all my efforts, I am unchanged. Unbidden,
      the Atlas Seeds gravitate towards the doorway, and I realize what is about to
      happen, if I let it.

      with my breathing. I can only assume that this is supposed to make me feel welcome.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_3: Can a Gek Trade Federation representative help you, friend?
    tra_request_text_3: The lifeform waits patiently. A faint melody whistles from
      holes in their beak.
    tra_request_desc_4: The trader's frantic beak-clicking seems to indicate that
      they are open to some stilted conversation and potential miscommunication.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_4: Trading friend demand immediate attention! SalesGek help?
    tra_request_text_4: Wild eyed, the lifeform hops from one foot to another as I
      consider my request.
    tra_request_desc_5: The trader is clicking their beak and drooling slightly. Just
      before the drop breaks free, they somehow manage to snort it back through their
      nasal holes.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_5: How can the Gek Trade Federation help you today?
    tra_request_text_5: The lifeform's babble means little to me. I struggle to concentrate
      on anything beyond the drool.
    tra_request_desc_6: The scent of this lifeform is as pleasant as it is intoxicating.
      There is pride in their eyes, perhaps as a result of the flowery gas that has
      engulfed the both of us.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_6: Gek Trade Federation is peaceful and loving! Please buy
      things!
    tra_request_text_6: The lifeform smiles at me gently. They wait.
    tra_request_desc_7: The alien clicks their beak with heightened energy. They stare
      at my exosuit and Multi-Tool, presumably wondering why I want to talk.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_7: Always trade with the Gek! The peaceful, benevolent Gek!
    tra_request_text_7: The lifeform repeatedly glances at my Multi-Tool. They wait,
      nervously, for my request.
    tra_request_desc_8: The small lifeform recently emitted a sweet-smelling gas.
      As the scent filters through my breathing apparatus, I feel my mind begin to
      slip gently towards the stars...
    dnt_tra_request_lang_8: Friend! Gek Trading Federation hopes you enjoy this system!
    tra_request_text_8: Concentrating, I bring myself back to this reality. When I
      blink, I see stars dance around the lifeform's head.
    tra_request_desc_9: The trader wants to make themself understood. They click their
      beak slowly and nod their head encouragingly. Their eyes sparkle in the light.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_9: Gek worker has admired your mining skills from afar!
    tra_request_text_9: The alien holds their breath. Their beak widens in anticipation
      of my reply.
    tra_request_desc_10: I am certain I have seen this strange lifeform watching me,
      tracking my movements. They glance up at me, innocently enough.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_10: Gek scent is alluring! A pleasure! A pleasure to converse!
    tra_request_text_10: In the warm and slightly scented presence of this little
      alien, the universe seems softer, more welcoming. I compose my request.
    tra_request_desc_11: The lifeform snaps their beak briskly shut. They stare at
      me, their thoughts clearly somewhere else.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_11: SalesGek duty to respond to customer queries!
    tra_request_text_11: Passive, the Gek waits for me to say something.
    tra_request_desc_12: The little alien fidgets, impatient.
    dnt_tra_request_lang_12: Yes. What? Gek hungry, lunch is late friend!
    tra_request_text_12: They stare at me. A faint grumble can be heard rumbling forth
      from some hidden orifice.
    exp_request_desc_1: The electronic lifeform pauses their work, looks up, and focuses
      their mask lights on my visor.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_1: Speech process operational. Hello. Entity awaits reciprocal
      traveller speech process.
    exp_request_text_1: "%NAME% waits for my request, but they seem desperate to get
      back to their research."
    exp_request_desc_2: The electronic lifeform looks up at me with interest. Their
      facial lights constrict as they stare deep into my visor.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_2: Ahem. Fascinating. Average intelligence traveller.
    exp_request_text_2: I pause. I cannot help but feel that countless analytical
      systems are recording and studying every move I make.
    exp_request_desc_3: The lights in the electronic lifeform's mask casing seem to
      constrict. They tilt their head slightly as they chitter at me, perhaps wondering
      what it is that I want.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_3: Entity provide data?
    exp_request_text_3: The lights in the entity's visor shine with increased intensity.
      They await my request.
    exp_request_desc_4: The electronic lifeform looks at my biological frame with
      something approaching pity. Not for the first time, I wonder what lies beneath
      the entity's mask.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_4: Korvax Echoes teach benevolence to low intelligence species.
    exp_request_text_4: Though they patiently await my request, I cannot escape the
      feeling that this entity is harvesting me for data.
    exp_request_desc_5: The lights in the electronic lifeform's casing start to brighten.
      They jerk their head sharply to the right, a strange buzzing noise signaling
      an on-rush of unseen data.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_5: Species scan operational. Hmm. Fascinating lifeform.
    exp_request_text_5: Whether the data was being sent or received, it seems the
      transmission is over. The lifeform focuses their attention on me once again.
    exp_request_desc_6: |-
      The lights in the lifeform's casing are wide and dim. As they turn to talk their mask becomes momentarily blank.
      They swiftly come back online, but I can't help but feel that their piercing gaze is that of a different entity altogether.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_6: Ahem. Korvax Entity help?
    exp_request_text_6: Whoever now inhabits this metal shell, they appear keen to
      communicate.
    exp_request_desc_7: A multitude of processes appear to be working within the electronic
      lifeform. Their lights flash quickly as they direct one of those processes towards
      me.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_7: 'Korvax Convergence speaks through entity: welcome traveller.'
    exp_request_text_7: I feel I am speaking not with one, but with many. I take my
      time as I compose my request.
    exp_request_desc_8: "The casing lights in the electronic lifeform's mask shine
      brightly. As they lean towards me, a bright flash burns into my retinas.\n \nAs
      the after-image subsides, the entity makes it clear that they are ready to converse
      with me."
    dnt_exp_request_lang_8: Speech process operational. Hello. Entity awaits reciprocal
      traveller speech process.
    exp_request_text_8: They entity waits. Despite their best efforts, they clearly
      haven't been able to predict what I want from them.
    exp_request_desc_9: The electronic lifeform speaks slowly, calmly and considerately.
      Their casing lights flash as they examine me.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_9: Excellent planetary research Traveller! The Korvax Convergence
      admires your work!
    exp_request_text_9: I feel a great many eyes watching me through that lone visor.
      I compose my request with care.
    exp_request_desc_10: My presence has made the lifeform somewhat curious. They
      buzz faintly to indicate that they are open to non-electronic communication.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_10: Korvax Convergence adores fascinating traveller. New
      Korvax research topic!
    exp_request_text_10: Some circuitry or intelligence allows the entity to comprehend
      me, though I cannot process their strange speech. They await my request.
    exp_request_desc_11: I feel the bright piercing gaze of the electronic lifeform.
      They seem extremely interested in what I have to say.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_11: Probable. Improbable. Fascinating.
    exp_request_text_11: Though their metal shell is polished and new, this electronic
      being has an air of great age about them. I choose my words carefully.
    exp_request_desc_12: The metal lifeform directs one of their visor lights towards
      me. Nonetheless, I feel as if I only have part of their attention.
    dnt_exp_request_lang_12: Busy entity awaits insignificant request.
    exp_request_text_12: The lifeform is clearly juggling multiple threads within
      their carapace. My request cannot come fast enough.
    war_request_desc_1: The warrior's hackles rise, and they start to shake in anticipation
      of my request. I must take care not to push them too far...
    dnt_war_request_lang_1: Vy'keen High Command insist warrior help pathetic interloper
      coward. Your question?
    war_request_text_1: "%NAME%'s disdain is palpable. Nonetheless, they contain themselves
      for now."
    war_request_desc_2: The warrior's movements indicate that their ancestors are
      not currently insulted. They make friendly barking noises.
    dnt_war_request_lang_2: Vy'keen warrior help pathetic, weak-minded interloper
      today?
    war_request_text_2: The lifeform seems less belligerent than others of their kind.
      They appear receptive to my request.
    war_request_desc_3: "The warrior seems less aggressive than I might expect.\n
      \nTheir lips curl over their teeth as they taste my scent."
    dnt_war_request_lang_3: Hail pathetic, weak-minded interloper. I serve requests
      with honour.
    war_request_text_3: I have passed muster with this combative lifeform. They listen
      with patience.
    war_request_desc_4: The warrior's lips curl over their teeth as they deliver a
      series of elegantly formed barking noises. Though far from friendly, they at
      least appear calm.
    dnt_war_request_lang_4: Interloper avoids offending Vy'keen ancestors today. Good
      news.
    war_request_text_4: The lifeform studies me intensely. I feel their mood could
      change rapidly should my request offend them.
    war_request_desc_5: The warrior, broad-shouldered and combative, issues forth
      with a series of harsh barks. They stare at me, waiting for a response.
    dnt_war_request_lang_5: Alert high. Enemies will suffer. Gek will be crushed.
      Interloper... currently acceptable.
    war_request_text_5: 'The lifeform continues to stare. There is a coiled, angry
      tension about them. '
    war_request_desc_6: The warrior's barks have a welcoming tone. My Exosuit's auditory
      sensors automatically turn down the relay volume.
    dnt_war_request_lang_6: Vy'keen High Command insist warrior help pathetic interloper
      coward. Your question?
    war_request_text_6: The warriors growls reflexively as they await my request.
    war_request_desc_7: The lifeform seems open to conversation. Their stance softens
      as they see my Multi-Tool, and there is a respect in their eyes.
    dnt_war_request_lang_7: Hail brave Vy'keen ally!
    war_request_text_7: The lifeform waits, tensing their knuckles. This must be what
      passes for patience amongst their kind.
    war_request_desc_8: "The warrior stares at me, as if in anticipation of a grave
      insult to their ancestry.\n \nAll of a sudden, their face turns. They deliver
      a sequence of amused yelps at my hesitation, before indicating that they are
      open to further conversation."
    dnt_war_request_lang_8: Holy ancestors smile on the interloper. Hirk will see
      deliverance!
    war_request_text_8: A smile still lingers in the lifeform's jaws. They await my
      request with a quiet amusement.
    war_request_desc_9: "The warrior shivers in anticipation before confronting me.
      They bark savagely, showing yellowed canines and a bloodied tongue.\n \nAs soon
      as the fury begins, however, it seems to be over. The lifeform nods solemnly,
      and indicates that they will hear my plea."
    dnt_war_request_lang_9: Interloper blood and Vy'keen blood run together. Glorious
      alliance!
    war_request_text_9: Though outwardly hostile and bristling, the lifeform is clearly
      a creature of honor. They listen patiently.
    war_request_desc_10: The warrior snarls, but does so deferentially. They make
      it clear that they are willing to talk to me.
    dnt_war_request_lang_10: Interloper ally! Peace ends soon! Your hand will deliver
      the Vy'keen!
    war_request_text_10: The lifeform's eyes dart about as they wait for my request.
      They are alert, on edge.
    war_request_desc_11: The warrior looks as if they might want something dead. Thankfully,
      it doesn't seem to be me.
    dnt_war_request_lang_11: Vy'keen warrior dislike pathetic, weak-minded coward
      species. Interloper... almost acceptable.
    war_request_text_11: The lifeform fixes me with a fearsome glare. I pause before
      delivering my request.
    war_request_desc_12: The warrior is making snarling noises that sound strangely
      upbeat. They seem more cheerful than others of their kind.
    dnt_war_request_lang_12: Death! Death! Death! Death! Death! Joyful warrior!
    war_request_text_12: I take my chance to present a request while the lifeform
      is in a good mood.

      My Builder is at their station, poring over some arcane project of their own. I am delighted they joined my team. Their enthusiasm is infectious, and they have a wealth of ideas for the expansion of this base. But before we make a start on construction, they insist on improving my navigational capabilities.

      <TECHNOLOGY>Beacons<> can be built using <IMG>BUILD_MENU<> and recoloured to remind you of a particular location.
    npc_hire_builder_lang_1: I'll provide the blueprints for any construction item
      you need, but before you start running around the galaxy in search of resources,
      allow me to present you with this <TECHNOLOGY>Beacon<> blueprint. Build a <TECHNOLOGY>Beacon<>
      to mark your location and you will be able to return there with ease.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_a_1: Thank you
    npc_hire_builder_res_a_1: You're welcome. We wouldn't achieve much if you got
      yourself lost and left me stranded here.

      Already, I have felt the benefits of having help on hand, but there are limits to what my Builder can achieve on their own. I have asked them to prepare the blueprints for a <TECHNOLOGY>Science Terminal<>. The all-round knowledge a Scientist could bring would open up enormous possibilities.

      In return, I am tasked with finding a supply of <SPECIAL>Spadonium<>, an element used in the delicate diagnostic circuitry of the new work station.
    npc_hire_builder_lang_2: The <SPECIAL>Spadonium<> I need to calibrate a <TECHNOLOGY>Science
      Terminal's<> diagnostic sensors is extracted from cacti that live in barren
      environments. Provide me with some, and I'll have this place ready for a Scientist
      in no time.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_a_2: Here's your Spadonium
    npc_hire_builder_res_a_2: Excellent. I shall look forward to having more company.
      I cannot abide solitude.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_b_2: I'll come back with the resources you need
    npc_hire_builder_res_b_2: Remember. Barren biomes. When you have the Spadonium,
      the plans will be waiting.
    npc_hire_builder_desc_3: A growing base needs good inventory storage. I ask my
      Builder to provide a design, but instead they offer me a short cut. If I travel
      to an abandoned building nearby, I should be able to salvage the plans for a
      suitable <TECHNOLOGY>Storage Container<> module.
    npc_hire_builder_lang_3: I need you to make your way to a nearby abandoned building.
      When you reach the abandoned terminal, upload its schematics to me. With a <TECHNOLOGY>Storage
      Container<>, you'll have more space to store items.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_a_3: I will investigate
    npc_hire_builder_res_a_3: Excellent. I've added the coordinates to your map.
    npc_hire_builder_desc_4: |-
      Though they never complain, I know my Builder would enjoy a larger team to work with. They have made it quite clear that they prefer company.

      When I raise the issue, my suspicions are confirmed. My Builder suggests recruiting an Armorer, and sets about preparing the design for a <TECHNOLOGY>Weapons Terminal<>. But the base's generators are stretched even now, so expansion will mean finding a reliable alternative power source. Perhaps a <COMMODITY>Voltaic Cell<> would do.
    npc_hire_builder_lang_4: There's no need to build a giant generator when individual
      batteries will meet all of our requirements. Ask a Scientist about <COMMODITY>Voltaic
      Cells<>. They're compact, portable, and powerful. Bring one to me and I'll incorporate
      it into the <TECHNOLOGY>Weapons Terminal's<> design.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_a_4: Here's a Voltaic Cell for you
    npc_hire_builder_res_a_4: Wonderful. Now you can run as many terminals as you
      need without blowing a fuse.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_b_4: I'll come back when I have one
    npc_hire_builder_res_b_4: Don't keep me waiting. Remember - talk to a Scientist.
    npc_hire_builder_desc_5: |-
      I am keen to inject a little variety into the architecture of my new home. My Builder is happy to draw up the blueprints for more building parts, but they also suggest an ingenious short cut.

      The drones that patrol the skies contain <SPECIAL>Pugneum<>, an element with the strange property of being able to hold digital information. If I can salvage a sample from a downed drone, my Builder can extract the plans for every building part the drone has ever scanned.
    npc_hire_builder_lang_5: To develop more building modules I need more data. In
      essence, a chip of <SPECIAL>Pugneum<> is nature's hard drive. Find me a destroyed
      drone, or take one down yourself, if you have the nerve.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_a_5: Here's your Pugneum
    npc_hire_builder_res_a_5: Thank you. These blueprints will broaden your architectural
      horizons considerably.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_b_5: I'll return later with a sample of Pugneum
    npc_hire_builder_res_b_5: Please do. You'll save me so much time for more interesting
      projects.
    npc_hire_builder_desc_6: |-
      As I survey my home, I think of the countless pioneers who have come before, forging their future with weapon and plough. Weapons I have, but perhaps it is time to turn the land to better use.

      I ask my Builder what we would need for a Farmer to join us here, and learn that the plans for an <TECHNOLOGY>Agricultural Terminal<> are already underway. My Builder believes the perfect solution lies in studying what has come before, and I am tasked with the delivery of <COMMODITY>Gek Charms<> that will assist them with their plans.
    npc_hire_builder_lang_6: The Gek were fine farmers even before they built their
      lost empire. Find me <COMMODITY>Gek Charms<> and I will examine their carvings
      for useful advice.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_a_6: I have the artefact you asked for
    npc_hire_builder_res_a_6: Excellent. This blueprint is tailor made for a Farmer.
      Have you given thought to where you'll find one?
    npc_hire_builder_opt_b_6: I'll be back later
    npc_hire_builder_res_b_6: You're the boss. When you're ready, I'll be here.
    npc_hire_builder_desc_7: |-
      As the base expands, the list of resources I need grows ever longer, but of all the requests made by my Builder, this latest is the strangest. When I asked about the possibility of making some decorative decals to brighten up our accommodation, they insisted the designs would require an adhesive made from <SPECIAL>Mordite<>.

      The collection of this foul substance, naturally, falls to me.
    npc_hire_builder_lang_7: "<SPECIAL>Mordite<> crystals form in the decomposing
      bodies of dead creatures. I don't know why you look so revolted. Your species
      are meat eaters, are you not?"
    npc_hire_builder_opt_a_7: Here is the Mordite you wanted
    npc_hire_builder_res_a_7: Leave it there for me. I'm not handling that stuff with
      bare hands.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_b_7: I'll be back when I have what you need
    npc_hire_builder_res_b_7: In the meantime, I'll draw up some decal designs for
      you to choose from.
    npc_hire_builder_desc_8: I have tasked my Builder with devising a means to reduce
      the coming and going that fills my day. They have suggested an <TECHNOLOGY>Autonomous
      Mining Unit<>; a machine that can extract the planet's resources without the
      need for constant supervision. Unfortunately, they are short of suitable <COMMODITY>Circuit
      Boards<> for the prototype.
    npc_hire_builder_lang_8: An <TECHNOLOGY>Autonomous Mining Unit<> will do the hard
      work while you're away, but that's just the start of my plans for you. I need
      <COMMODITY>Circuit Boards<> for all manner of devices. You'd better pay a visit
      to the <TECHNOLOGY>Science Terminal<>.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_a_8: I've got your Circuit Board
    npc_hire_builder_res_a_8: Perfect. Here are the blueprints for your AMU.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_b_8: I'll come back when I have one
    npc_hire_builder_res_b_8: Don't keep me waiting. Remember - talk to a Scientist.
    npc_hire_builder_desc_9: |-
      At the Construction Terminal, I am ambushed by my Builder, who asks that I consider building a <TECHNOLOGY>Landing Pad<> for the base. Something to do with 'keeping up appearances', they tell me, though quite who they are trying to impress, I do not know.

      Perhaps it is a quirk of their race's culture, but my builder insists that any base with many rooms simply must have a landing pad.
    npc_hire_builder_lang_9: Every dwelling of a certain size must have a <TECHNOLOGY>Landing
      Pad<>. It is vital that we are always ready to accept guests. Do we have the
      rooms yet?
    npc_hire_builder_opt_a_9: Yes, we have the rooms
    npc_hire_builder_res_a_9: Marvellous. Here are the blueprints. I will prepare
      for visitors... just in case.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_b_9: No, I haven't built enough
    npc_hire_builder_res_b_9: Well don't just stand there. Get building.
    npc_hire_builder_desc_10: |-
      My Builder is keen to establish a line of trade between our humble outpost and the wider galaxy. We have been generating a surplus of resources that could be sold for profit.

      As luck would have it, the solution falls well within their realm of expertise. They offer the blueprints for a <TECHNOLOGY>Galactic Trade Terminal<>, and ask only that I find a supply of <COMMODITY>Insulating Gel<> suitable for the new terminal's circuitry.
    npc_hire_builder_lang_10: Access to the Galactic Trade Network requires only the
      appropriate Terminal, but if those things overheat while you're trading you
      can lose millions. Go see a Scientist. They know how to make the <COMMODITY>Insulating
      Gel<> I need.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_a_10: I've got all the gel you need
    npc_hire_builder_res_a_10: Wonderful. A universe of mercantile opportunity awaits.
      The Gek would be proud of you.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_b_10: I'll come back another time
    npc_hire_builder_res_b_10: Be sure you do. This could be a highly profitable venture.
    npc_hire_builder_desc_11: |-
      My builder has kindly offered me a gift containing a number of new building module blueprints.

      The blueprints include a <TECHNOLOGY>Glass Cuboid Room<>, a <TECHNOLOGY>Holo-Door<> and decorative <TECHNOLOGY>Coloured Lights<> that should help further improve the base.
    npc_hire_builder_lang_11: Hello friend, after all the help you've given me with
      my research I wanted to show you my appreciation. Here are some blueprints for
      more building modules, I think they will make the place look great.
    npc_hire_builder_opt_a_11: Thanks
    npc_hire_builder_res_a_11: You're welcome. I hope that these blueprints will further
      broaden your architectural capabilities.
    npc_hire_builder_wait_desc_1: My Builder is engrossed in their plans. Clearly,
      this is an ill-timed visit. They mutter to me without looking up from their
      station.
    npc_hire_builder_wait_lang_1: Busy. Busy. Focus is paramount. Come back later
    npc_hire_builder_wait_opt_a_1: Please excuse the interruption
    npc_hire_builder_wait_res_a_1: Of course. Come back when I've cracked this puzzle.
    npc_hire_builder_recr_desc_1: The being grabs my hand and shakes it vigorously
      as I approach them. Their wide-set eyes fix me with a friendly gaze and I am
      not surprised when they speak to me in my own language.
    npc_hire_builder_recr_lang_1: My good friend what luck for both of us. I am a
      specialist in construction, in search of a new position. Have you established
      a planetary base? If so, give me a terminal to work at and I'll build you the
      foundations of an empire.
    npc_hire_builder_recr_opt_a_1: Recruit Overseer
    npc_hire_builder_recr_res_a_1: You will not regret our association. I have the
      coordinates of your planetary base. I'll meet you there... what is the word...
      oh yes. Boss.
    npc_hire_builder_recr_opt_b_1: There are preparations I must attend to before
      I can hire a Builder
    npc_hire_builder_recr_res_b_1: Very well. A base and a Construction Terminal is
      what I'll need to begin work.
    npc_hire_farmer_desc_1: |-
      The new recruit seems well acquainted with the Agricultural Terminal as they bring the device to life my senses are flooded with a strange scent and I find myself infected by my new assistant's zeal.

      They are eager to begin farming the land, and have brought seeds ready to sow. Our first crop will be <TRADEABLE>Bloodsbane<>, useful for the <SPECIAL>Sac Venom<> it produces. Additionally we will need a <TECHNOLOGY>Hydroponics Tray<> to plant them in.
    npc_hire_farmer_lang_1: A fresh supply of <SPECIAL>Sac Venom<> is vital for many
      formulae. And with the toxins boiled out, it can add a real kick to your cooking,
      too. Remember to plant the <TRADEABLE>Bloodsbane<> indoors to ensure a successful
      crop. You'll need these <TECHNOLOGY>Hydroponics Trays<> to plant inside. Shall
      we get this farm started?
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_a_1: Accept Bloodsbane
    npc_hire_farmer_res_a_1: I'm not the only one with 'green fingers', eh? The fruits
      of your labor will soon swell our stores.
    npc_hire_farmer_desc_2: |-
      My Farmer assures me that a great variety of plants can be encouraged to grow here. Some, however, have hidden dangers.

      My crop of <TRADEABLE>Bloodsbane<> is a good example. One drop of its pungent sap could leave me temporarily paralysed. The solution is technical; I must ask an Armourer to help me build a <TECHNOLOGY>Haz-mat Gauntlet<> before attempting to handle any more hazardous materials.
    npc_hire_farmer_lang_2: The <SPECIAL>Venom Sacs<> in <TRADEABLE>Bloodsbane<> will
      quickly burn through your gloves and into your veins. Build a <TECHNOLOGY>Haz-mat
      Gauntlet<> if you want to handle hazardous plants without harm. The design is
      well within the ability of any specialist Armorer.
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_a_2: I've already built a Haz-Mat Gauntlet
    npc_hire_farmer_res_a_2: A wise decision. Here. Try this Gravitino Orb crop when
      you have time. With your gauntlet, you can handle any of the exotic plants.
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_b_2: I'm not ready to build that
    npc_hire_farmer_res_b_2: Well don't wait too long or your Armorer will be drawing
      up the blueprints for a mausoleum.
    npc_hire_farmer_desc_3: My Farmer has an idea that could make us rich. They have
      suggested that we grow a crop of <SPECIAL>Albumen Pearl Orbs<>, and are already
      planning to spend the units we'd make on new equipment. It amuses me that farming,
      the humblest of pursuits, can still sometimes yield the greatest rewards.
    npc_hire_farmer_lang_3: My scans reveal the remnants of an ancient settlement
      where <SPECIAL>Albumen Pearls<> were once grown. Visit the ruins to see if some
      seed fragments remain.
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_a_3: Can you mark the ruins on my map?
    npc_hire_farmer_res_a_3: Yes. I've pinpointed the spot where Albumen Pearls were
      once harvested. Good luck with your search.
    npc_hire_farmer_desc_4: |-
      I am not given to questioning the expertise of my assistants, but my Farmer's latest request stretches my credulity.

      In order to perfect their latest cultivar, I have been tasked with gathering a sample of <SPECIAL>Coprite<>, taken from the faecal matter of overfed wildlife.
    npc_hire_farmer_lang_4: The useful <SPECIAL>Mordite<> crystals that form when
      some creatures decompose can be cultivated in a local tuber called <TRADEABLE>Carrion
      Root<> this will be our reward. However unfortunately for you, <SPECIAL>Coprite<>
      is the only substance that will encourage my seedlings to grow. It forms in
      the droppings of animals that have been overfed.
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_a_4: Here's your Coprite
    npc_hire_farmer_res_a_4: Thank you. Do remember to wash your hands.
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_b_4: I'll return when I have your sample
    npc_hire_farmer_res_b_4: Thanks. I'm sorry to ask, but someone has to do it.
    npc_hire_farmer_desc_5: |-
      After the last foul task my Farmer devised for me, I am almost nervous to approach them. And perhaps with good cause. Their experiments with Coprite continue.

      At least the foul smelling stuff is proving useful. My Farmer plans to use it in the creation of a new crop, and I am tasked with planting the <TRADEABLE>Gravitino Orbs<> that will be fused with the already provided Coprite to create a <TRADEABLE>Coprite Orb<> plant.
    npc_hire_farmer_lang_5: Coprite can be added to the DNA sequence of <TRADEABLE>Gravitino
      Orbs<> to produce a versatile new plant. Have you any growing on your farm already?
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_a_5: Yes, we are growing Gravitino Orbs
    npc_hire_farmer_res_a_5: Wonderful. Don't worry about the new plant's odor. The
      smell of Coprite is neutralized by the Gravitino Orbs.
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_b_5: No. We are not growing Gravitino Orbs
    npc_hire_farmer_res_b_5: Okay. Remember that need to set them growing before I
      can finish this work.
    npc_hire_farmer_desc_6: |-
      With careful adjustment to their genetic code, my Farmer has been able to encourage crops from every conceivable habitat to grow on our farm.

      Lately, they have turned their attention to fungi, which they hope will provide spores for the <TRADEABLE>Puffball<>. In order to modify the plants for cultivation, however, I have been asked to provide a sample of <SPECIAL>Rigogen<> from the leaves of an underwater plant.
    npc_hire_farmer_lang_6: I have all but finished the adaptations to this <TRADEABLE>Puffball<>
      mushroom's DNA sequence. Once I introduce <SPECIAL>Rigogen<>, the new cultivar
      will be ready to grow. Can you help?
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_a_6: Here's the Rigogen you asked for
    npc_hire_farmer_res_a_6: Excellent. Future harvests will reward your inconvenience.
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_b_6: I'll come back when I have it
    npc_hire_farmer_res_b_6: I'll be waiting. Remember you'll find what we need underwater.
    npc_hire_farmer_desc_7: |-
      My Farmer's knowledge of agricultural crops is encyclopedic. It seems there is no corner of this or any world that does not prompt some fresh suggestion from them.

      They have set their sights on growing Skywort, a flowering whose crystalline blooms can be ground to form a fine, durable glass. Fused with Antrium, it should survive transplantation from the frigid climate in which it is found.
    npc_hire_farmer_lang_7: "<TRADEABLE>Skywort<> is the crowning glory of any farm
      and has many uses. Growing it is relatively easy, but to transplant it from
      its snowy home, I will need <SPECIAL>Antrium<>, a luminous substance common
      to cave plants."
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_a_7: I have the Antrium you need
    npc_hire_farmer_res_a_7: You won't regret it. Skywort can be processed to produce
      a fine, strong glass.
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_b_7: I will return when I have the resources
    npc_hire_farmer_res_b_7: See that you do. I must have that Antrium before I can
      make progress.
    npc_hire_farmer_desc_8: |-
      My Farmer has a talent for planting complementary crops. One plant's excretions provide the nutrients for another.

      When I enquire about their studies, my assistant beseeches me to lend a hand with their work. By sowing naturally radioactive <TRADEABLE>Carrion Root<>, we can encourage the more delicate crop <TRADEABLE>Dictotyl<> to grow.
    npc_hire_farmer_lang_8: I have prepared a tray of <TRADEABLE>Dicotyl<> seedlings.
      These small flowers usually require high levels of radiation to thrive, but
      by first sowing <TRADEABLE>Carrion Root<>, we can feed the <TRADEABLE>Dicotyl<>
      with radiation from the root's Mordite crystals.
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_a_8: I have planted some Carrion Root
    npc_hire_farmer_res_a_8: Once again, you have saved me from the dirty work. Thank
      you.
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_b_8: I'll talk to you again once I've planted Carrion Root
    npc_hire_farmer_res_b_8: Good. Remember to wear your Haz-Mat Gauntlet when you're
      handling that stuff.
    npc_hire_farmer_desc_9: My Farmer has expressed a keen interest in succulents,
      but plants accustomed to the barren lands in which cacti thrive must be grown
      indoors. <COMMODITY>Glass<> will be needed for seed trays that will be used
      to encourage the <TRADEABLE>Cucrassula<> seedlings to grow.
    npc_hire_farmer_lang_9: I am confident that <TRADEABLE>Cucrassula<> would grow
      well. But the seedlings must be started under <COMMODITY>Glass<>. If you don't
      have any, a Scientist will provide a solution.
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_a_9: I have the Glass you need
    npc_hire_farmer_res_a_9: My most sincere thanks. Baked Cucrassula is a personal
      favorite of mine.
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_b_9: I will need to find some Glass before I can help
    npc_hire_farmer_res_b_9: Like I said, ask a Scientist.
    npc_hire_farmer_desc_10: My Farmer's interest in fauna extremophiles grows. They
      have presented me with a sample of <TRADEABLE>Vivilava<> - a strange living
      rock that grows in extreme heat. I am charged with fetching a mineral called
      <SPECIAL>Viridium<> to feed its delicate root system.
    npc_hire_farmer_lang_10: I hope my request will not send you too far afield. The
      <SPECIAL>Viridium<> I need is found only within mineral deposits found in the
      terrain of Green star systems.
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_a_10: I have the Viridium you need
    npc_hire_farmer_res_a_10: That's good news. I appreciate that not all of my requests
      are easily answered.
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_b_10: I'll return with your Viridium when I can
    npc_hire_farmer_res_b_10: I hope you don't have too far to travel.
    npc_hire_farmer_desc_11: |-
      My Gek assistant is nibbling on a baked Cucrassula as I approach. I decline the portion they offer politely, hoping my refusal will not cause offence.

      I need not have worried. My Farmers is more than happy to keep it for himself.
    npc_hire_farmer_lang_11: Suit yourself. They are our finest crop. Indeed, with
      the farm thriving like it is, I don't think there's anything else I can teach
      you.
    npc_hire_farmer_opt_a_11: Okay. Thanks for all of your help
    npc_hire_farmer_res_a_11: You're welcome. Thanks for the Cucrassula. You don't
      know what you're missing.
    npc_hire_farmer_wait_desc_1: My Farmer is enjoying a brief rest. Their day is
      long, and I do not want to rob them of these quiet moments.
    npc_hire_farmer_wait_lang_1: Your patience is appreciated. I promise I will be
      back on my feet soon.
    npc_hire_farmer_wait_opt_a_1: I'll leave you in peace
    npc_hire_farmer_wait_res_a_1: Please come back later. A short rest is all I need.
    npc_hire_farmer_recr_desc_1: |-
      I am confronted by a being who is eager to make a good impression on me. They are a farmer, and looking for employment.

      I consider the offer carefully. A farm is a reliable source of tradable goods. Once established, it could increase my spending power considerably.
    npc_hire_farmer_recr_lang_1: No one will serve your farming needs better than
      I, I assure you. Do you have a planetary base? Provide a Terminal for me there
      and my services are yours.
    npc_hire_farmer_recr_opt_a_1: I could do with a Farmer. You're hired
    npc_hire_farmer_recr_res_a_1: A sound decision. I will gather my belongings and
      meet you on your land.
    npc_hire_farmer_recr_opt_b_1: Sorry, I'm not hiring at the moment
    npc_hire_farmer_recr_res_b_1: If you change your mind, I'll be here. Unless I've
      been snapped up by someone with more foresight.
    npc_hire_weapon_desc_1: My Armorer has a more holistic approach to their plans
      than I expected. When I enquire about new weapons, they suggest that we start
      by improving my capacity to gather resources. I am offered the blueprints for
      a new exosuit adaptation; a <TECHNOLOGY>Haz-mat Gauntlet<> capable of handling
      radioactive and toxic materials that would otherwise be harmful.
    npc_hire_weapon_lang_1: Weapons can wait. You'll need this <TECHNOLOGY>Haz-mat
      Gauntlet<> for handling hazardous fauna. Or would you like to be remembered
      for being defeated by a plant?
    npc_hire_weapon_opt_a_1: Thank you
    npc_hire_weapon_res_a_1: It's a start. We will make a warrior of you yet.
    npc_hire_weapon_desc_2: |-
      Negotiating employee relations with a weapons specialist is a delicate task, and my Armourer's brusque manner does not help.

      I must take care not to offend them. They have the means to register their displeasure most violently. The <TECHNOLOGY>Plasma Torpedos<> they have prepared for my ship are a case in point. Once their guidance systems have been calibrated with the <SPECIAL>Gravitino Ball<> by Armourer has requested, they will be a formidable weapon indeed.
    npc_hire_weapon_lang_2: |-
      The path of life is strewn with the corpses of the unprepared.

      I can offer you additional protection for your ship, but these <TECHNOLOGY>Plasma Torpedos<> require <SPECIAL>Gravitino Balls<> for their guidance systems. Have you been farming <SPECIAL>Gravitino Orbs<>?
    npc_hire_weapon_opt_a_2: I have a Gravitino Ball already
    npc_hire_weapon_res_a_2: Well hand it over. One must always be ready to fight.
    npc_hire_weapon_opt_b_2: I'll be back when I have what you need
    npc_hire_weapon_res_b_2: See that you return swiftly. Patience is not my strong
      point.
    npc_hire_weapon_desc_3: Before they turn their attention to my ship's weapon systems,
      my Armorer demands that I add one further tool to my kit; an <TECHNOLOGY>Advanced
      Mining Laser<>, to aid in gathering the resources that our munitions will require.
    npc_hire_weapon_lang_3: You can't extract the minerals I require for your arsenal
      with that basic laser of yours. My latest scan revealed unauthorised mining
      underway close by. If I were you I'd find the trespasser and confiscate their
      technology so we can copy its circuitry.
    npc_hire_weapon_opt_a_3: Please mark the miner on my map
    npc_hire_weapon_res_a_3: Done. They may not be built as weapons but advanced lasers
      pack some serious power. Bear that in mind if your trespasser behaves aggressively.
    npc_hire_weapon_desc_4: |-
      Here, on my new home world, I feel secure. But the lawless space that surrounds us weighs heavily on my mind.

      I have tasked my Armorer with providing new weapons systems for my ship. Their solution is a <TECHNOLOGY>Photon Blast<> weapon, based on Vy'keen technology, but to finalize the design they will need to consult <TRADEABLE>Vy'keen Daggers<>.
    npc_hire_weapon_lang_4: Your ship must be ready for close combat. The Vy'keen
      have a powerful <TECHNOLOGY>Photon Blast<> weapon I could adapt. Seek out their
      <TRADEABLE>Vy'keen Daggers<> for clues to the design.
    npc_hire_weapon_opt_a_4: I have the Vy'keen Dagger you asked for
    npc_hire_weapon_res_a_4: The blueprint is yours. Take care that it does not fall
      into hostile hands.
    npc_hire_weapon_opt_b_4: I'll be back when I have the Vy'keen Dagger
    npc_hire_weapon_res_b_4: Do not delay. Without improved weapons, we remain vulnerable
      to attack.
    npc_hire_weapon_desc_5: |-
      My Armourer is warming to their purpose at last. I am promised the designs for a formidable rapid-fire weapon. But while they finalise their plans for a <TECHNOLOGY>Photon Accelerator<> weapons upgrade, I must undertake an urgent errand for them.

      Their work has exposed them to poisonous toxins which only the element <SPECIAL>Coryzagen<> can counteract. Fortunately, there is a source available to us on frozen planets.
    npc_hire_weapon_lang_5: My experiments have brought me into contact with toxic
      minerals. A tea made from <SPECIAL>Coryzagen<> which can be extracted from <TRADEABLE>Skywort<>
      will counter the exposure. If you are not farming it, look in the snow.
    npc_hire_weapon_opt_a_5: Here. Take this Coryzagen
    npc_hire_weapon_res_a_5: Not a moment too soon. This will soon flush the toxins
      from my body. I hope this weapon is worth my headache.
    npc_hire_weapon_opt_b_5: I'm sorry. I'll return soon with Coryzagen for you
    npc_hire_weapon_res_b_5: Be sure that you do. Wait too long and you may be too
      late to help.
    npc_hire_weapon_desc_6: |-
      My Armourer is muttering over their terminal as I approach. Apparently, they have reached some impasse in their latest project; an upgrade to the <TECHNOLOGY>Ion Blast<> weapon for my Starship.

      They reject my offer to help, insisting that only the specialist assistance of a Scientist will prevent these problems in future.
    npc_hire_weapon_lang_6: I can only do so much. This places needs the support of
      a dedicated Scientist if I am to make further progress, and unless you build
      a <TECHNOLOGY>Science Terminal<> you will never be able to recruit one.
    npc_hire_weapon_opt_a_6: I've built the terminal you requested
    npc_hire_weapon_res_a_6: Good. I managed to complete my blueprints this time,
      but with a Scientist on board we'll save a lot of time.
    npc_hire_weapon_opt_b_6: I'm not going to build that right now
    npc_hire_weapon_res_b_6: Suit yourself, but until you build that terminal, you
      won't be seeing new weapons from me.
    npc_hire_weapon_desc_11: The sad news my Armorer imparts comes as no surprise.
      They have transformed my ship in the time we have worked together, but now our
      working relationship has been exhausted.
    npc_hire_weapon_lang_11: There is nothing more I can teach you. Not without breaking
      several interplanetary arms treaties, at least.
    npc_hire_weapon_opt_a_11: You have my gratitude
    npc_hire_weapon_res_a_11: And you mine. Choose your battles wisely.
    npc_hire_weapon_wait_desc_1: My assistant is making repairs to their own blaster.
      They do not seem to be going well. If I interrupt them in this mood, I may find
      myself used for target practice.
    npc_hire_weapon_wait_lang_1: Wretched thing. I should give up and strip it for
      parts.
    npc_hire_weapon_wait_opt_a_1: I can come back later
    npc_hire_weapon_wait_res_a_1: Lasers. Bah. Give me old fashioned projectiles.
    npc_hire_weapon_recr_desc_1: |-
      This being has the upright demeanor of a warrior. Their sidearm is a custom piece that shows remarkable workmanship.

      When they turn to speak, I instinctively reach for my own blaster.
    npc_hire_weapon_recr_lang_1: Relax. I'm an Armourer, not an assassin. Perhaps
      you have need of my skills. Do you have a base? Give me a terminal to work at,
      and I'll build you an arsenal that will shake the heavens.
    npc_hire_weapon_recr_opt_a_1: You're hired
    npc_hire_weapon_recr_res_a_1: A wise decision in this violent age. Let me gather
      my belongings. I will make my own way to your planet's surface.
    npc_hire_weapon_recr_opt_b_1: I'm not looking for an Armorer right now
    npc_hire_weapon_recr_res_b_1: So be it. With luck, you will never have cause to
      regret that decision.
    npc_hire_scientist_desc_1: |-
      My Scientist assesses the work station I have provided with a critical eye. I trust nothing has been forgotten. It would be a shame to delay their work.

      Their contended muttering suggests that I have done reasonably well. My assumption is confirmed when I am presented with a gift; the blueprints for a <COMMODITY>Voltaic Cell<>.
    npc_hire_scientist_lang_1: The work station is acceptable but my designs will
      be mere ornament without power. I have devised a powerful portable battery for
      you. You will need <SPECIAL>Antrium<> to catalyse production of the cell. It
      can be harvested from plants that grow in caves.
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_a_1: Accept Voltaic Cell Blueprint
    npc_hire_scientist_res_a_1: Excellent. These Voltaic Cells will power any tech
      we devise.
    npc_hire_scientist_desc_2: |-
      My Scientist's knowledge of the elements is encyclopedic. They pointedly refuse, however, to do their own field work. While they finalize the design of the wiring for our base, I am invited to undertake a short journey on their behalf.

      Their scanners have picked up a signal worthy of investigation.
    npc_hire_scientist_lang_2: I'm far too busy to leave my station. There's a signal
      we need to investigate; a distress call, or part of one, that originates from
      a nearby Radio Tower. Will you make the journey?
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_a_2: Of course
    npc_hire_scientist_res_a_2: Thank you. What hope is there for any of us if we
      ignore distress signals?
    npc_hire_scientist_desc_3: |-
      The presence of an all-rounder on my team is unlocking many possibilities. Each new discovery leads to another's inspiration.

      Their latest innovation is a strong, <COMMODITY>Non-ferrous Plate<> suitable for all manner of technologies, but to refine the design, I must venture into an inhospitable radioactive environment for a supply of <SPECIAL>Candensium<>. Notably I will need a <TECHNOLOGY>Haz-mat Gauntlet<>. I should consult an Armourer before handling the plant.
    npc_hire_scientist_lang_3: "<COMMODITY> Non-ferrous Plate<> is the foundation
      of many technologies. Once reinforced with <SPECIAL>Candensium<> from radioactive
      plants, it will be ideal for your purposes. You can find it in radioactive biomes,
      but beware you will be need a <TECHNOLOGY>Haz-mat Gauntlet<> to handle the leaves."
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_a_3: Yes, I have Candensium
    npc_hire_scientist_res_a_3: Perfect. The blueprints are yours.
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_b_3: No, but I will return with some when I can
    npc_hire_scientist_res_b_3: Very well. Watch your Exosuit's life support levels
      carefully while you're looking for it.
    npc_hire_scientist_desc_4: |-
      While the breadth of their knowledge is useful, it is sometimes difficult to get my Scientist to focus on the task in hand.

      I am in dire need of <COMMODITY>Circuit Boards<> for the base's electronics, but they are absorbed in their own studies. If I fulfill their request to gather the <SPECIAL>Sac Venom<> they want to examine, perhaps I can get them back on track.
    npc_hire_scientist_lang_4: The work you set me interferes with my taxonomical
      investigation. I'll draw up the plans for the <COMMODITY>Circuit Board<> you
      need, but you must provide a sample of <SPECIAL>Sac Venom<> for my collection.
      You can harvest it from <TRADEABLE>Bloodsbane<>, and is rarely found on planets.
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_a_4: I have what you need
    npc_hire_scientist_res_a_4: Thanks. You think me eccentric, but there is much
      to learn from cataloguing nature.
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_b_4: I'll fetch your Sac Venom and return later
    npc_hire_scientist_res_b_4: Take care to wear your Haz-mat Gauntlet when handling
      it. Medicine is not my strongest field.
    npc_hire_scientist_desc_5: Without <COMMODITY>Glass<> to grow under, only the
      hardiest seedlings will survive my Farmer's attempts at cultivation. Fortunately,
      our little colony relies on teamwork, and my Scientist's ingenuity knows no
      bounds. Their solution is natural, renewable, and plentiful throughout the galaxy.
      Skywort.
    npc_hire_scientist_lang_5: The crystalline flowers of Skywort can be processed
      into <COMMODITY>Glass<> of the highest quality. Build a waypoint <TECHNOLOGY>Beacon<>
      to aid our fieldwork and I'll draw up the blueprints. If you get lost, all of
      my hard work will be wasted.
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_a_5: I've built a Beacon
    npc_hire_scientist_res_a_5: Excellent. It will aid us in future expeditions.
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_b_5: I haven't built a Beacon yet
    npc_hire_scientist_res_b_5: Are you determined to get lost? When you've rectified
      the situation, I'll be here.
    npc_hire_scientist_desc_6: |-
      At the Science Terminal, my assistant can barely contain their delight. They have made a breakthrough in their search for a tough, synthetic <COMMODITY>Poly-fiber<> for the base's cabling.

      Their experiments have depleted their supplies, however, and I am asked if I can provide them with more <COMMODITY>Copper Wire<>.
    npc_hire_scientist_lang_6: My synthetic <COMMODITY>Poly-fibre<> will provide strong,
      long-lasting cable for all of your needs, but I used up all my <COMMODITY>Copper
      Wire<> in the prototyping stages. Do you have any to replace my stocks?
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_a_6: Yes, I have the Copper Wire you want
    npc_hire_scientist_res_a_6: Thank you. Here. Take the blueprints. Power, data,
      you name it, this Poly-fiber will do the job.
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_b_6: Not the moment. I'll be back when I do
    npc_hire_scientist_res_b_6: Thank you. Come back soon. I can make little progress
      without it.
    npc_hire_scientist_desc_7: |-
      Lately, my Scientist has turned their attention to chemistry. The fumes from their latest experiment almost overcome me as I approach their terminal.

      They are developing a powerful <COMMODITY>Acid<>, but it requires one more ingredient if it is to be stabilized for use. An element called <SPECIAL>Temerium<>.
    npc_hire_scientist_lang_7: "<SPECIAL>Temerium<> is present in the gills of toxic
      fungi. Its stabilizing properties should counter these fumes. The sooner you
      provide me with some, the sooner you can stop holding your nose."
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_a_7: Here's the Temerium you requested
    npc_hire_scientist_res_a_7: You have my thanks. Collaboration is the key to all
      scientific endeavor.
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_b_7: I don't have any, but I'll be back when I do
    npc_hire_scientist_res_b_7: Don't be too long. The air in here is getting hard
      to breathe.
    npc_hire_scientist_desc_8: The fumes hanging over my Scientist's work station
      are less noxious than before, but their equipment is covered with a thin layer
      of translucent slime. They have been working on an <COMMODITY>Insulating Gel<>,
      but are unable to complete the formula. Perhaps I can help.
    npc_hire_scientist_lang_8: Ah. You find me at a difficult moment. This <COMMODITY>Insulating
      Gel<> needs work. I based my formula on a language that is not my own, gleaned
      from a nearby monolith. Perhaps I missed something. Will you visit the site?
      Maybe you can find a clue that will resolve the confusion.
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_a_8: Please mark the Monolith on my map
    npc_hire_scientist_res_a_8: Done. Good luck with your investigation.
    npc_hire_scientist_desc_9: |-
      I shall be glad when my Scientist has had their fill of chemistry. I am forced to hold my nose as I inspect their latest project; an advanced engine lubricant.

      I am glad when they ask a favour of me that will take me away from their work. And even happier when I learn that the <TRADEABLE>Korvax Convergence Cube<> I'm asked to deliver may hold the key to neutralising the noxious fumes that their experiments produce.
    npc_hire_scientist_lang_9: A good <COMMODITY>Lubricant<> is vital wherever there
      are moving parts. If you don't like the smell, there may be a solution. The
      Korvax developed an olfactory blocker that will neutralise any odour. Their
      <TRADEABLE>Korvax Convergence Cubes<> may hold the key to its manufacture. Then
      again, you can always hold your nose.
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_a_9: Here is the Convergence Cube you requested
    npc_hire_scientist_res_a_9: Thank you, but I fear I sent you on a wild goose chase.
      I found a way to neutralize the smell myself while you were gone.
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_b_9: I'll return with your Korvax Convergence Cube when
      I can
    npc_hire_scientist_res_b_9: Thank you. In the meantime I'll keep experimenting.
    npc_hire_scientist_desc_10: |-
      I have been warned that my Scientist is experimenting with <COMMODITY>Explosive<> materials today. As I approach, they are cursing in their native tongue.

      In an attempt to calm them, I ask if there is anything I can do to help. A supply of <SPECIAL>Rubeum<>, they tell me, would make their work much less dangerous and difficult.
    npc_hire_scientist_lang_10: There is no room for error when working with <COMMODITY>Explosives<>
      I could stabilize this formula with <SPECIAL>Rubeum<>; an element that occurs
      only in the rocks of Red star systems. Do you have any? The sooner this job
      is done, the sooner we can all relax.
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_a_10: Here's the Rubeum you need
    npc_hire_scientist_res_a_10: And here are the blueprints with my formula for Explosives.
      They're more stable now, but still dangerous, so take care.
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_b_10: I will find some and bring it to you
    npc_hire_scientist_res_b_10: Thank you. If you return to find a hole in the ground,
      you'll know what has happened.
    npc_hire_scientist_desc_11: The Science Terminal is unusually quiet as I approach.
      My Scientist shakes their head as they scroll through their notes on-screen.
    npc_hire_scientist_lang_11: There is more I could teach you, but not without years
      of study on your part. For now, I'm afraid, our partnership has exhausted its
      potential.
    npc_hire_scientist_opt_a_11: Your work has been vital. Thank you
    npc_hire_scientist_res_a_11: You're most welcome. Knowledge is its own reward.
    npc_hire_scientist_wait_desc_1: My Scientist has many talents, but diplomacy is
      not one of them. They could learn much from my Builder, with whom they share

      One being piques my interest. They are tapping their fingers together absent-mindedly and reciting the details of some complex chemical formula.

      The <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Radar<> blueprint holds great promise; I have already discovered so much with the technician's aid, and even now they forge upgrades to my <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft's weapon system<>.

I walk through worlds of ruin and wonder at these peoples, at their obsession with their past, at the hatred that tore them asunder. I wonder what the future might hold, what secrets might echo out through the hub of creation.

      You approach the monolith. You are engulfed in its terrible truth. You see its words in the text of a thousand tongues, in the ephemera of countless stars.

      You witness events that occurred millennia before your awakening. You see two Vy'keen standing before a red glow, asking it of the universe. You see a Gek and a Korvax, waiting side by side before you. And before the vision ends, you see a vision of something you have not seen before. Of something that does not belong in this or any place. Of hatred, grief, despair. Of something that is yet to come.

      You see all this, and then it is over. The monolith has nothing more to show you.
    npc_hire_vehicles_lang_11_s: Know that I heard the word of the Atlas where Hirk
      had heard nothing. In its rage, in its impotent jealousy, Hirk struck me from
      the mountain and I saw the truth of what the Monolith had said. That my end
      would be an awakening. That in this dream, nothing should perish. Or so it would
      be until the Travelers. So it would be until the destruction of realities. Know

Their heresy is now truth, and although there are those among the Vy'keen who will still pursue them, the Cultists of Nal will find themselves with new power in this galaxy. Yet still the technician has remained, promising to assist me as I assisted them, until such time as I no longer require their services.

      The lifeform offers me blueprints for Exosuit upgrades in exchange for Nanite Clusters.

      Their facial lighting brightens as they see me. They produce multiple datapads, held with perfect balance from the tips of their silicon fingers.

      They sniff at me, invading my personal space and almost reaching for my suit before looking me over and thinking again. They bounce, nervously.
    tra_techshop_lang_1: You -- you have Nanite Clusters? I can grant you blueprints
      for ship upgrades in return. Please, if I don't make my quota this month, they'll

    exp_buildshop_desc_1: The lifeform stands in my home, uninvited, unafraid. Lights
      dance across its mask as it scans the area, before it abruptly turns to me.
      It shows me <TECHNOLOGY>Blueprints<> of structures, of augmentations that might
      be valuable to my base. Something is sad about its tone.
    exp_buildshop_lang_1: 'Traveler: prime home? Carapace? Korvax echo can provide
      that which it has lost.'
    exp_buildshop_desc_2: The lifeform stares at the imperfections, at the empty corners
      of my home. It casts holograms where there is nothing, seeing the potential
      where I saw only space. It turns to me, the light of its mask dilating briefly
      before it expands in a sad glow. It shows me <TECHNOLOGY>Blueprints<> of what
      I might build one day.

      wonder. It says a few words before it falls utterly silent, showing you a datapad
      full of its <TECHNOLOGY>Blueprints<>. It keeps turning its gaze to what you
      have built, tilting its head.
    exp_buildshop_lang_3: Honor! To witness the monolith of the Traveler. Honor! Please!
      Korvax contribute. Korvax augment the Traveler's Prime!
    exp_buildshop_desc_4: The lifeform stands utterly silent for a moment, its mask
      almost without light. It meditates in what you have built. When it shows you
      its <TECHNOLOGY>Blueprints<>, it utters only a few strange words.
