    ui_guide_body_pinning: |-
      Instructions for how to craft <TECHNOLOGY>new technology<>, <COMMODITY>products<> and <EARTH>building parts<> can be <VAL_ON>pinned<> as a mission.

      Pin recipes using <IMG>PIN<> for items and <IMG>PIN_BUILD<> for base parts.

      Pinning creates an entry in your <VAL_ON>Mission Log<> with step-by-step instructions on how to find or create the component parts of that item. Only one item can be pinned at a time.

      As well as recipes, <STELLAR>guides to locate raw materials<> can also be pinned. Pin these instructions from the <VAL_ON>Catalogue<>.

      Recipes can be pinned wherever you see the product or technology listed: within the <TECHNOLOGY>Build Menu<>, or from any <VAL_ON>popup<> in the Inventory.
    ui_guide_topic_weather: Extreme Weather
    ui_guide_body_weather: |-
      Most planets suffer from occasional <FUEL>storms<>. During a storm, your <STELLAR>hazard protection<> will <STELLAR>drop much faster<> than usual.

      New explorers are advised to take shelter during storms if possible. Those with more experience may wish to take advantage of the weather's impact on equipment; for example, <TECHNOLOGY>Freezing Temperatures<> improve the <STELLAR>heat efficiency<> of the Mining Beam.

      Some planets have <FUEL>extreme weather<>. Your Exosuit will warn you when you set foot upon such a world. Hazard levels are much higher on these worlds, and storms are more frequent. <TECHNOLOGY>Hazard Protection Upgrades<> are strongly recommended before exploring such planets.

      However, such worlds offer rewards to the brave explorer. <STELLAR>Resource deposits<> are worth considerably more. <STELLAR>Activated<> forms of the stellar metals sell for high prices, and can be refined into vast stores of <SPECIAL>Chromatic Metal<>.

      <COMMODITY>Storm Crystals<> can be found on extreme weather planets. These are highly valuable rare resources, and can only be harvested during an active storm. Search for them using the <TECHNOLOGY>Analysis Visor<>.
    ui_guide_topic_guilds: Guilds
    ui_guide_body_guilds: |-
      As well as the main races, the galaxy is home to three large <STELLAR>Guilds<>: the <VAL_ON>Merchants Guild<>, the <VAL_ON>Explorers Guild<> and the <VAL_ON>Mercenaries Guild<>. These guilds span the races, so trade-inclined Vy'keen may join the Gek-dominated Merchants Guild, for example.

      Improve your standing with the Guilds by undertaking missions from the <SPECIAL>Mission Board<> on Space Stations. Increasing your standing will allow access to higher-level missions and more valuable rewards.

      Each <COMMODITY>Space Station<> has an <TRADEABLE>Envoy<> from one of the Guilds. Visit this envoy in each system you visit to collect rewards based on your standing. Track your standing on the <VAL_ON>Journey Milestones<> section of the Catalogue & Guide (<IMG>OPTIONS<>).
    ui_guide_topic_guns: Buying New Multi-Tools
    ui_guide_body_guns: |-
      New Multi-Tools can be purchased in <COMMODITY>Space Stations<> and <VAL_ON>Planetary Outposts<>. Upgrade your Multi-Tool inventory at a Space Station.

      After purchase, your Multi-Tool can be <STELLAR>renamed<>.

      Six Multi-Tools can be owned at a time. Trade in your existing Multi-Tool for a discount on new models. Technology will need to be reinstalled in new models.

      Different styles of Multi-Tool can dramatically increase your ability to <STELLAR>harvest resources<>, <TECHNOLOGY>scan discoveries<> or <FUEL>fight<>. Multi-Tools can also be found at different base power levels: <TRADEABLE>C<>, <TECHNOLOGY>B<>, <SPECIAL>A<> and <COMMODITY>S-Class<>.

      Some damaged Multi-Tools may be acquired for free. This is an excellent way to acquire high-value technology on a limited budget. The slots in these tools will need to be repaired to restore the device to full capabilities.
    ui_guide_topic_ships: Buying New Ships
    ui_guide_body_ships: "Purchase ships wherever you see pilots landing: at <COMMODITY<>Space
      Stations<>, <STELLAR>Freighters<>, <TECHNOLOGY>Planetary Outposts<>,  or <VAL_ON>other
      small buildings<>. \n\nAfter purchase, your new ship can be <STELLAR>renamed<>.
      You can own up to <VAL_ON>nine<> ships in your fleet. Use the <TECHNOLOGY>Quick
      Menu<> to summon your ships at any time.\n\nAlternatively, trade in your existing
      ship for a discount on your new vessel. Technology will need to be reinstalled
      in new models. <FUEL>Do not forget to transfer cargo first!<>\n\nSome damaged
      starships may be acquired for free. This is an excellent way to acquire high-value
      technology on a limited budget. The technology in these ships will need to be
      repaired to restore it to full capabilities.\n\nShips come with specialisations,
      increasing their stats and altering their handling capabilities. Examine different
      starships at a space station to learn more. Ships come in a range of classes:
      <TRADEABLE>C<>, <TECHNOLOGY>B<>, <SPECIAL>A<> and <COMMODITY>S-Class<>."
    ui_guide_topic_new_base_parts: Learning New Base Parts

    ui_guide_body_upload: |-
      Every creature, plant, rock, planet or system you discover can be <TRADEABLE>renamed<> and <STELLAR>uploaded<>. You may also rename your <VAL_ON>base, Multi-Tool, and starship<>.

      Uploading shares your discovery with other Travellers. Any Traveller who finds that object will see you as the original finder. Uploading rewards <TECHNOLOGY>Nanites<>.

      Discover creatures, plants and rocks with the <TECHNOLOGY>Analysis Visor<>. Enter visor mode with <IMG>AIM<>. Analyse your targets with <IMG>BINOCSCAN<>.

      Systems and planets are discovered automatically when visited.

      Track, rename and upload your discoveries from the <VAL_ON>Discoveries Page<> of the Options Menu.
    ui_guide_topic_ammo: Ammunition
    ui_guide_body_ammo: |-
      Most Multi-Tool <FUEL>weapons<>, such as the <TECHNOLOGY>Boltcaster<> require <VAL_ON>ammunition<>. Craft ammunition in empty slots in your Inventory.

      While in combat, <VAL_ON>Reload<> your current weapon with <IMG>RELOAD<>. This will automatically draw ammo from your inventory. Ensure you have crafted sufficient ammunition <STELLAR>before<> entering a combat situation.

      All projectile-based weapons use the same ammunition: the <TECHNOLOGY>Boltcaster<>, the <TRADEABLE>Pulse Spitter<> and the <COMMODITY>Scatter Blaster<>.

      Energy based weapons, such as the <FUEL>Blaze Javelin<>, are charged with <FUEL>carbon<> directly from the Quick Menu or the Inventory. The Mining Beam is not advised for use in combat.

      When out of ammo or charge, use <IMG>MELEE<> to <VAL_ON>melee strike<>.

    ui_guide_topic_signals: Finding Buildings
    ui_guide_body_signals: |-
      The <VAL_ON>Cartographer<> on Space Stations will supply <STELLAR>Planetary Charts<> for specific buildings. Using these charts will mark a site on your Exosuit's HUD.

      Collect <STELLAR>Navigation Data<> from the beacons outside planetary buildings. Exchange this data with the <VAL_ON>Cartographer<> for additional maps. The Cartographer will also sell charts for nanites.

      Larger buildings create detectable signals, either through direct transmission or via their radar signature. When exploring on foot, use the <TECHNOLOGY>Analysis Visor<> to search for nearby buildings, or build (<IMG>BUILD_MENU<>) a <TECHNOLOGY>Signal Booster<> to mark the closest structure to your position.

      Specialist <SPECIAL>navigation data<> reveals the location of <VAL_ON>Drop Pods<>, which contain powerful <TECHNOLOGY>Exosuit Upgrades<>. These should be decoded in a Signal Booster.
    ui_guide_topic_refiner: Refining Substances
    ui_guide_body_refiner: |-
      Advanced materials and construction may require the use of a <TECHNOLOGY>Refiner<>. Construct a refiner from the Build Menu (<IMG>BUILD_MENU<>). Large refiners require a <VAL_ON>habitable base<>.

      Refiners take harvested or raw materials and process them into more condensed or advanced materials.  <VAL_ON>Refined elements<> (eg <FUEL>Condensed Carbon<>) not only take up less space, but also provide greater charge to basic systems than common elements (eg <FUEL>Carbon<>).

      <TECHNOLOGY>Larger refinery units<> take multiple inputs, allowing the user to experiment with the <VAL_ON>combination of materials<>. Combining materials may generate <VAL_ON>exclusive substances<> or allow for <VAL_ON>more efficient recipes<>.

      Simple, portable refiners require external fuel to use. Large refiners wired into the structure of a <VAL_ON>base<> do not.
    ui_guide_topic_dismantle: Portable Technology
    ui_guide_body_dismantle: |-
      Technology deployed on the planet's surface from the Build Menu (<IMG>BUILD_MENU<>) may be recovered by approaching and holding <IMG>DECONSTRUCT<>. This places the technology in the user's <TECHNOLOGY>Exosuit Inventory<>.

      <TECHNOLOGY>Dismantling<> technology offers a convenient way for the user to transport and <TECHNOLOGY>redeploy the technology<> at a location of their choosing.

      Redeploying portable technology <VAL_ON>incurs no additional costs<>. The unit only needs to be constructed once.

      <COMMODITY>WARNING<>: Do not forget the location of your deployed technology.
    ui_guide_topic_fleets: Freighter Fleets
    ui_guide_topic_fleetsa: Fleet Expeditions
    ui_guide_body_fleets: |-
      Command of a large <COMMODITY>Capital Ship<> offers several benefits. High among these is the ability to command a fleet of <SPECIAL>Frigates<>.

      Find and purchase <SPECIAL>Frigates<> to add them to your fleet.  Recruitable frigates in a <TECHNOLOGY>freighter group<> will be marked with an icon. Approach a <TRADEABLE>recruitable frigate<> and speak with them on the <TECHNOLOGY>Starship Communicator<>.

      There are several types of frigate, and each individual ship varies in quality. While not on expeditions, frigates will perform tasks related to their abilities. Land on a frigate to collect the rewards from these tasks.

      <STELLAR>Trade frigates<> will accumulate wealth, <TECHNOLOGY>science vessels<> will provide scans to ancient artifacts, <FUEL>supply ships<> will generate fuel, and <COMMODITY>mining vessels<> will collect minerals. <SPECIAL>Combat ships<> will come to your aid if you fight nearby pirates.
    ui_guide_body_fleetsa: |-
      Expeditions require a <TECHNOLOGY>Fleet Command Room<>. Construct a Command Post in the habitable area between the bridge and the hangar.

      The <TECHNOLOGY>Navigator<> plans expeditions for your fleet. Visit the Navigator on the freighter's bridge to see currently available expeditions. A new set of expeditions are plotted each day. Expeditions have varying <TECHNOLOGY>specialisations<> and <FUEL>difficulty<>.

      Higher-class ships will contribute more to any <VAL_ON>Expedition<> you send them on. Completing expeditions will increase the strength of a frigate.

      Longer or larger expeditions require more fuel. Supply ships reduce fuel requirements. Expeditions can be equipped with <COMMODITY>temporary upgrades<> to boost their capabilities.

      Expeditions cover long distances and may take a considerable amount of time to complete. Track the expedition's progress at the <TECHNOLOGY>Fleet Command Room<>. Expeditions continue in real time and do not require their owner to be actively present.
    ui_guide_topic_technology: Upgrading your Equipment
    ui_guide_body_technology: |-
      Visit the <STELLAR>Marketplace<> aboard most Space Stations to find a wide array of merchants. Technology merchants will sell <VAL_ON>Upgrade Modules<>. Upgrade your Exosuit, starship and Multi-Tool inventories aboard Space Stations.

      <TECHNOLOGY>Blueprints<> allow you to craft new technologies. Purchase blueprints aboard the <SPECIAL>Space Anomaly<>.
      You will have to find the materials yourself, but you will always be able to install the technology in your Exosuit, or any <STELLAR>starship<> or <TECHNOLOGY>Multi-Tool<> you own.

      <VAL_ON>Upgrade Modules<> are one-off purchases. They upgrade a specific <VAL_ON>Exosuit<>, <STELLAR>starship<> or <TECHNOLOGY>Multi-Tool<> technology you have already installed. Each upgrade has slightly different properties, and users are advised to experiment with different configurations.
      Install an Upgrade Module by selecting it in the Inventory with <IMG>FE_ALT1<> and deploying it to an empty <TECHNOLOGY>Technology Slot<> with <IMG>SELECT<>.

      Upgrades installed adjacent to other upgrades of the same type will provide an additional boost, further improving device performance.

      You cannot have more than <FUEL>three<> upgrades active for the same technology subsystem. Doing so will cause the upgrades to become non-functional until sufficient modules are removed to restore power.
    ui_guide_topic_recipes: Recipes and Blueprints
    ui_guide_body_recipes: |-
      <VAL_ON>Upgrade Modules<> can be purchased ready crafted from technology merchants. These merchants are also a useful source of pre-built components. Seek them out in the Space Station Marketplace, or find them in smaller <STELLAR>planetary shops<>.

      To craft <COMMODITY>products<> and <TECHNOLOGY>technologies<> yourself, you must learn their blueprints.

      Learn the plans for specific technologies by visiting research stations aboard the <SPECIAL>Space Anomaly<>.

      Product recipes are more rare and must be sought out by raiding various <STELLAR>planetary installations<>. Find directions to such installations by exchanging navigation data with a space station <TRADEABLE>Cartographer<>.
    ui_guide_topic_feeding: Feeding and Taming Creatures
    ui_guide_body_feeding: |-
      All creatures will eat <TRADEABLE>Creature Pellets<>. Creatures can be fed directly, or via the <VAL_ON>Creatures section of the Quick Menu<> (<IMG>QUICK_MENU<>).

      Bait thrown from the Quick Menu may placate <FUEL>predators<> or other angry creatures, unlocking new farming or traversal opportunities.

      Feeding a creature will gain their trust and allows them to be <STELLAR>mounted<> or <TRADEABLE>farmed<>. A tame creature can also be <STELLAR>adopted<> as your companion. Animal companions offer a range of friendship and traversal opportunities.

      Manage your companions via the Quick Menu (<IMG>QUICK_MENU<>). Take good care of your companion and they may lay eggs, allowing the breeding of a new generation of unique creatures. Eggs can be exchanged with other Travellers.

      The <TECHNOLOGY>Egg Sequencer<> on the <SPECIAL>Space Anomaly<> allows for genetic modification, opening the doors for the infinite potential of life...

      All creatures will eat <TRADEABLE>Creature Pellets<>. Creatures can be fed directly, or via the <VAL_ON>Utilities section of the Quick Menu<> (<IMG>QUICK_MENU<>).

      Special abilities are unlocked with more advanced bait. Scan creatures with the <TECHNOLOGY>Analysis Visor<> to discover their bait preference. Deploy specific bait from the Quick Menu.

      Advanced bait allows creatures to be <STELLAR>mounted<> or <TRADEABLE>farmed<>. Create advanced bait in the <TECHNOLOGY>Nutrient Processor<>. Bait is typically processed from a base of <FUEL>Coprite<> or <SPECIAL>Mordite<>, blended with local ingredients. Experiment mixing a base with plants or meat to create new bait types.

    update4_notes: |-
      No Man's Sky NEXT brings a vast array of new features. For full details please see www.nomanssky.com.

      * Multiplayer: Team up a small team of friends and explore the universe together.
      * Visual Overhaul: The game is fully playable in third or first person, both on-foot and in ship.
      * Command Freighters: Assemble and upgrade a fleet of frigates and command them from the bridge of your freighter.
      * Unlimited Base Building: Bases can now be built anywhere on any planet.

      The universe has been regenerated to make room for the various changes and features being added. As a result, planetary biomes, terrain and lifeforms have been changed, and your location may also be slightly adjusted. Bases have been temporarily archived but can be restored at any base computer.

      Hello Games has been hard at work to improve and expand No Man’s Sky. We hope you enjoy :)
      Thank you so much,

    npc_waterplaque_title: The Voice of the Shell
    npc_waterplaque_desc: I hear a voice, soft but insistent, growing ever louder
      as I linger before the ancient altar. It flows closer, the water rushing about
      me, demanding that I listen to its tale.
    npc_waterplaque_opt: Accept the waves
    npc_waterplaque_res: I pull back and the roar of the oceans subsides. As the light
      of the ruin fades, I find an ancient key, perfect despite its age.
    npc_waterplaque_1: |-
      I went down to the beach today. There's something about the sea at this time of year. It draws you in, distorts your sense of time. Salty frost on stubby grass, the sand blowing off the tops of the dunes. No-one else for miles.

      People love the sound of waves, but it takes grey skies and high winds to really feel it, to understand their never-ending crash, the drum they beat upon the land. It makes me shiver.
    npc_waterplaque_2: |-
      I went back to the shore this morning, just for a walk to clear my head. I trod the dunes as usual, my heater turned up in contrast to the freezing winds. But then I saw it.

      A clear glass sphere, picked out by the glint of the rising sun. Utterly perfect, no colour to taint it, no chips to spoil its perfect geometry.

      I took it, of course. I've marvelled at it all day, watching how the light changes as it passes through, filtered and pure.
    npc_waterplaque_3: |-
      The shore walks have become a habit now, a daily ritual. I've walked for miles, treading the sand, crunching shells beneath my feet, searching for another pebble like that first.

      I've gotten faster, more efficient. I don't need the sun any more. My torch does just as well, sweeping the rocks, searching for that flicker of light, some hope of reflected perfection.

      The only thing that stops me now is the tide, and I almost didn't notice that last night. The salty water around my ankles brought me round.
    npc_waterplaque_4: |-
      The suit complains, but I found a way to bypass the salinity alarms. I never need to stop now, whatever mood the tide takes. The water level has risen this year, and without these modifications I'd have lost my old shore paths long ago.

      I miss the dunes, but needs must. I can't afford to retreat inland like the others, and besides - the glass looks just as pure and brilliant in the water as it does the air.
    npc_waterplaque_5: |-
      I've surveyed uncountable millions, but there's nothing. All the other rocks look so drab and dull, so lifeless, so damaged. No matter how deep I go, there's never anything to match it.

      I see whole worlds, stars, reflected in its brilliance. I know there must be more out there.
    npc_waterplaque_6: "It's gone. \n\nI took it out this morning and I saw it, faint
      but unmistakable. A crack, no more than a hair, but enough. Its light no longer
      pure, but tainted with a crimson diffusion.\n\nI couldn't bear to look at it.
      After all I've done for it, it lets me down like this? Get out! <STELLAR>Broken<>,
      <FUEL>awful<>, <SPECIAL>stupid -<>"
    npc_waterplaque_7: |-
      I found it. It took me days, but I found it. The worst days since I left the surface. I missed it so much.

      The fault was all mine. When I found it, it was still as perfect as the day I found it. But my eyes... something is changing.

      I'm so glad it's back.
    npc_waterplaque_8: |-
      I took my glove off this morning, to better grasp my pebble. The time down here has changed me. How long has it been? I've lost track...the green gave way to blue so long ago.

      My hands are clear, pure. The light shines through me. Like glass. I -

      It was my turn to dive today. Once again, nothing of interest. Nothing but kelp and rocks.

      LOG: <STELLAR>0115C<>. Breach Event <STELLAR>+21 Sols<>
      The secondary dive team came back early today. They found a cave full of strange crystals, but the lights on the sub cut out and forced them home.
      They seem upset, disturbed. But we have to go back while we still have an idea of where it is, before the shifting tides rob us. We'll never build anything without advanced materials.

      We found the cave! I knew we would, but what a find!
      Great towering crystals of brilliant red, rich metal deposits, concentrated deuterium, all we could ever need. We might just make it after all. Now if only we could get a dry night's sleep...

      I had the dream again.
      The endless purple waves, mile after mile after mile. A relief at first from that dull crimson ache. But then... I can't escape the feeling there's something else there. I look around, and there's nothing. Nothing.
      I blink, and I see them. Faint at first, just lines. But it's unmistakable. Repeated geometric shapes, traced in the sky. Row after row of triangles, slowly scrolling past. And I can't explain it, but it's the most terrible thing I've ever seen.
      It's almost a relief to wake up and see the rain again.

    npc_comm_week_05_brief: |-
      Friend! Hello! I have spent sleepless sols puzzling over the coordinates we retrieved, cross-comparing with the Anomaly's databanks, returning empty over and over. The possible realities fan out infinitely, with only that single transmission to navigate by...
      But another signal has flickered across the boundaries. A Traveller-friend we thought had been lost! Their communicator suddenly from the darkness, signalled Nada and Polo! Such unspeakable happiness!
      The transmission frequency was so close, almost aligned, to those messages from beyond the breach. I have triangulated an equivalent location in this reality - would you travel there, return our Traveller-friend home?
    npc_comm_week_05_brief_res: |-
      I am transmitting you coordinates for the portal, friend. But you must use all of your caution!
      We are still learning, friend, still not understanding where all this leads. Once on the planet, stay low to the ground, out of the skies. I have made an adjustment to your exocraft navigation. It will provide all the guidance you need.
    npc_comm_week_05_cap: So many stories, friend, thank you, but there is a bitter
      taste to them. I cannot bear any more unhappy endings. Let us make this our
      final transmission for now.
    npc_comm_week_05_cap_opt_a: Transmit data
    npc_comm_week_05_cap_res_a: Polo nods in thanks, their expression inscrutable.
      They tell me they have transferred a gift to my accounts, and that I might spend
      it on something of comfort.
    npc_comm_week_05_comp: Have you brought news, and friendship? Did friends unite?
    npc_comm_week_05_comp_opt_a: Tell about the crash site
    npc_comm_week_05_comp_res: Polo slumps into themselves, looking defeated. They
      seem to look inwards for several moments before speaking.
    npc_comm_week_05_comp_res2: |-
      This is very sad news.
      There must be a way... I am sure... to reach back... but I am ahead of myself. There is more work I must do, and it will take real, linear time.
      Friend - are there more untold stories out in this reality? More star vessels left broken and flightless in the dirt? Please tell me... anything you find.
    npc_comm_week_05_comp_res_all: This data brings grief with it, friend, but the
      stories are precious. Have you discovered more?

    npc_comm_week_05_comp2_opt_b: End transmission
    npc_comm_week_05_comp2_res_a: Polo nods seriously. They say nothing, but I sense
      they still want to know more.

      It is hard to lose contact, friend. But these echoes are merely one loop from the infinite. Life, success, tragedy - Nada and Polo and the Traveller-friend will see all these outcomes.

    npc_comm_week_06_story_desc5a: I hear the welcome of the ancient monument, words
      etched directly into my mind. How will such a thing react to Polo's manipulations?
    npc_comm_week_06_story_desc5b: The glitchy static around the Traveller's 'beacon'
      clears, a strong, fresh signal replacing the ancient static. Polo's process
      leaves me more apprehensive by the moment.

    npc_comm_week_06_story_res_a5: |-
      I hear the familiar drone, the deep chimes of the glyphs. The stranger activates the portal and prepares to step through.
      I have never heard the moment of transit from the outside before. I do not wish to again.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_res_b5: |-
      You're right <STELLAR> - kzztk - <> of course, you're right <STELLAR> - kzztk - <> madness.
      But where next? Where <STELLAR> - kzttzzzztk - <> now? We should have just <STELLAR> - kzztk - <> drunk the water...
    npc_comm_week_06_story_lang6: Polo's strange device has led me to another wreck.
      I stand before the shattered remains of its bridge computer, feeling as if this
      strange journey is nearly at an end.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_start: The computer plays a series of fragmented videos,
      recordings that could not have been made with any normal camera.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_opt: View recording
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_1: |-
      I see the stranger carve the glyphs into the portal's stone. They step across the threshold, and the blue glow of the portal flashes a deep crimson. A terrifying, otherworldly scream resonates across the entire portal structure. The gateway closes soon after, its connection severed, any way back closed forever.
      The recording ends soon after.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_2: |-
      I see the stranger turn their back on the portal and return to their trudge across the lonely landscape. Their crewmates fall one by one, until the stranger walks alone.
      The pace of the recording accelerates and the static buildup strengthens. I spool through hours of tape, but the stranger continues to wander, living off the land, never returning to their ship.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_3: |-
      I see the stranger turn their back on the portal. They are alone, their crew consumed by whatever strange being they met at the abandoned building. Leaving the portal seems to have freed them from whatever strange spell had been haunting their sleep. They stumble, then look around, frantic.
      The recording shows them retracing their steps, always alone, until they reach the crash site. They build a shelter, keeping vigil for their fallen friends.
      Suddenly, I hear a noise behind me. I scan the wreck, but see nothing. As I turn back to the terminal, I see the recording has ended.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_4: |-
      The stranger carves a series of glyphs into the portal, then steps across the threshold.
      The recording warps slightly, but continues. I see the stranger standing on a hexagonal world, dwarfed by the wreck of a large starship. Their starship? They help a figure to their feet, a Korvax. With a jolt, I recognise Nada.
      The Priest Entity seems to stare right at me, aware that I have seen this reunion. They nod, and the recording ends.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_5: |-
      I see the stranger hesitate, then turn their back on the portal gateway. They look over their shoulder as they walk away, as if they heard a voice from across the threshold. As the recording continues, I see them return to the abandoned building where they met the traveller who promised them aid.
      They search the building, attending frequently to the control terminal, growing ever more distraught. Their saviour never appears, the being with the glowing mask never returns. The stranger cries, alone. They go to sleep on the floor of the building. The recording ends.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_6: "The stranger carves a series of glyphs into the
      portal. They pause, as if called by a familiar voice. Seeing no-one, they continue
      across the threshold. A burst of static cuts the recording.\nWhen the image
      returns, I see the stranger on the bridge of their freighter, surrounded by
      their crew. A Korvax priest entity joins them. With a shock, I recognise Nada.
      \nWithin moments, chaos has erupted on the freighter. Sentinel fighters swarm
      the ship, their assault sending it into freefall. Another burst of static cuts
      across the recording. The final image is a single frame of a Gek specialist
      attending their radar station."
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_7: |-
      I see the stranger turn away from the portal, a sad shake of their head. But there seems to have been a mutiny. Their surviving crewmates ignore their pleas and enter the portal, unheeding. They are consumed by the foam, and the portal closes with a crimson flash.
      The stranger walks a short distance, shaken. They assemble a small shelter, enter and close the door. The recording does not show them emerge.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_8: |-
      The strangers carves their glyphs into the portal's stone. They stride towards the threshold, confident, as if called forward by a familiar voice. They enter, and a brilliant flash of white distorts the recording.
      When the image settles, the portal is nowhere to be seen. All I see are stars, an endless parade of systems. The recording settles on a star and closes in rapidly. The same flash of light, and a new world blinks into existence.
      The recording ends. What have I just witnessed?
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_9: |-
      I see the stranger tap the control panel of the portal, their hands guided by an unseen force. The gateway opens, its blue light spilling out onto the surrounding landscape.
      In this light, the stranger addresses their remaining crew. They try to persuade them to follow into the portal, but with no success. One by one, the crew walk away. Only the stranger remains.
      Finally, they begin their approach. The foam consumes them, then dies down. The portal quietly closes. The recording shows nothing more.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_10: |-
      I see the stranger examine the open portal, then step away. The recording shows the rest of their movements. They continue to travel, mile after mile, always at night. Each light source is found, examined, discarded.
      They search each abandoned building they find, looking for the traveller who promised them salvation. The tapes seem to loop forever. I spool forwards through hour after hour of material, the pattern never varying, the stranger never seeming to age.
      I search and search, but find no end to this story.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_11: |-
      I see the stranger activate the portal and walk towards the open gateway. They hesitate as they reach the threshold, turning back to their crewmates for encouragement. They step forward, and are consumed by the foam.
      A burst of static interrupts the recording. When it ends, I see the stranger surrounded once more by their crew. They look old, far older than the moment before. But they are happy - the relief on all their faces is clear to see. A ship lands in the distance, and the group sets off.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_12: |-
      I see the stranger turn away from the portal, but it clearly pains them. The recording shows their reluctant steps away from the threshold, their repeated glances back over their shoulder.
      The recording continues as the crew and the stranger part ways. The group heads towards a settlement in the distance, the stranger towards the empty horizon.
      As the images jump forwards, the stranger spends their time hauling large red minerals to a small shelter. They carve them endlessly, a parade of geometric shapes rendered in crimson stone. They fall down, exhausted.
      I cannot fathom any meaning from the glyphs they carve.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_13: |-
      I see the stranger tap tentatively at the portal's control panel. They open the gateway and walk across the threshold.
      As the foam settles, another being approaches the still-active portal. A traveller, their face obscured by a blinding light. They follow the stranger into the portal's blue light.
      The structure's ancient stone bends and warps, buckling under some extreme force. At last, the traveller re-emerges. The portal closes. There is no sign of the stranger.
      Though this is a recording, I cannot help the feeling that the traveller has noticed me. I close the terminal quickly.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_14: |-
      I see the stranger turn their back on the portal and hurry away quickly. They return to the wreck of their small starship and begin entering data into the distress beacon. I see the red crimson orb...
      The recording cuts out, placing the stranger back at the portal. It just shows this loop over and over. I search for an error, some corruption in the data that would explain this odd loop. I find none.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_15: |-
      I see the stranger input a series of glyphs, then step forwards into the portal. Before the gateway closes, I see another figure enter, a shimmering being, their face obscured by a brilliant light. The recording cuts out, interrupted by a burst of static.
      When the recording returns, the stranger is aboard their ship, before we ever made contact. There is a Korvax on the bridge. With a jolt, I realise it is Nada. They look extremely concerned. Before I can see more, the terminal begins to glow white hot, the screen consumed by a burning white flame.
    npc_comm_week_06_story_end_16: |-
      I see the stranger turn away from the portal. They walk slowly, tired and unsure. Eventually, they wander back to the site of their crashed ship.
      I look closely at the distress beacon at the crash site. There is a faint red light spilling from its interior, the haunting crimson I have seen so many times before.
      The stranger paces around the beacon, unsleeping. They continue their vigil for days. They walk slower and slower, and eventually collapse. As they do so, their fallen body takes on the same red glow.
      The recording ends.

      It has all led here, friend! The coordinates we've pursued, the strange new seeds in the earth, the dimension-bridging echoes from other traveller-friends. It all aligns! An aftershock, booming through the stars!
      Hundreds of thousands of dormant planets, now wakened, yawning, bursting with new discoveries!

      did not hear me, or are choosing to ignore my question.
    exp_first_station_res_2: A glazed look passes over the lifeform's visor. The number
      has had some strange effect on them. They seem reluctant to speak further.
    exp_first_station_res_3: The code has a strange effect on the lifeform. Their
      lights freeze, their voice stutters. After a moment, they appear to restart.
      They do not seem to remember what I said.
    tra_first_station_res_1: A look of surprise crosses the lifeform's face and they
      release a strange-smelling gas. This appears to signify our conversation is
      over.
    tra_first_station_res_2: Startled by my question, the lifeform emits a dramatic
      squeak. Though I do not recognise their words, the shake of their head is unmistakable.

      the code, but my words have clearly had a dramatic impact on them.
    war_first_station_res_1: The alien draws back, startled. The look on their face
      tells me our conversation is over.
    war_first_station_res_2: Hearing the code seems to cause the lifeform to shrink,
      a look of fear crossing their face. And then, in an instant, the fear passes.

      their helpful demeanor has vanished. They clearly have no interest in hearing

    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_1: The client operates a large educational institute
      in this system. They seek ancient artifacts for their collection.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_2: The client is an outcast, shunned by their contemporaries
      for their beliefs about the past.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_3: The client comes from a wealthy family, and wishes
      to learn more about their lineage.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_4: The client has been studying the Sentinels for many
      years, and hopes to make a breakthrough by looking to the past.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_5: The client has a particular interest in novel pathogens.
      They believe there is an untapped well of disease lurking in the distant past.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_6: The client hopes to understand the technology of
      the past, with the aim of improving the technology of the future.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_7: The client had to flee their homeworld after an
      environmental catastrophe. They hope to understand the roots of this disaster
      by examining the past.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_8: The client has recently discovered a priceless family
      heirloom. They seek similar artifacts, so that they might understand their own
      history in context.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_9: The client has learned a disturbing fact about their
      ancestry and seeks clarification about the past.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_10: The client has been studying the history of our
      common ancestor and seeks help in gathering new source material.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_11: The client is worried that civilisation may be
      heading towards a collapse. Through study, they hope to avoid the mistakes of
      the past.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_12: The client believes they have found an ancient
      genetic link between the Gek and the Vy'keen. Such information could prove politically
      destabilising, so they seek additional proof from the fossil records.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_13: The client is a keen student of the past, and they
      hope to make a name for themselves at the local historical society.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_14: The client is interested in ancient ruins and their
      contents. They do not believe the ruins were built by proto-Gek, nor ancient
      Vy'keen. They seek artifacts to help prove their thesis.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_15: The client is tired of modern life. They seek fragments
      of the past, so that they might reconstruct the superior culture of our forebears.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_16: The client is a 'medical' researcher with a keen
      interest in how chemicals are absorbed by the gut. They seek ancient ruins,
      hoping to collect samples of things eaten by those now long dead.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_a_17: The client operates a moderately successful mining
      company. They are seeking to diversify their operation, and wish to test the
      viability of commercial-scale archaeology.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_b_1: 'They are particularly interested in written records
      from the distant past. The data is sufficient: they do not need the physical
      source.'
    npc_mission_digging_proc_b_2: They require relics of all types. The pieces will
      be scanned and the records entered into their personal database.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_b_3: They seek explorers to aid them. Any unearthed artifacts
      will belong to the discoverer - they only ask for scan data or digital copies
      of the sample.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_b_4: They are particularly keen to recover scans of any
      ancient cultural artifacts. Once recorded, the field agent is free to keep the
      physical sample.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_b_5: There are large gaps in their historical records,
      and they seek field agents for archaeological expeditions to fill in this missing
      data.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_c_1: They will independently verify any data. Those attempting
      to pass new objects as ancient will be reported to the relevant authorities.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_c_2: The client has requested only artifacts over 100
      years old. New samples will be automatically rejected.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_c_3: The client notes that relics of the Korvax are accepted
      but not preferred.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_c_4: The client requests that the field agent supplies
      their own spade and / or other supplementary digging equipment.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_c_5: The client accepts no liability for any ancient
      curses that may afflict the field agent during the commission.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_c_6: The client accepts no liability should the field
      agent become trapped in a hole, a pit or any other excavation during the course
      of the commission.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_c_7: The client advises that pirates in this system have
      recently entered the artifact market, and that field agents should take appropriate
      caution.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_c_8: The client advises the field agent to show discretion
      in this matter and not to give away the location of any digsites to less scrupulous
      relic-hunters.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_c_9: The client notes that responsibility for any diseases
      or other terrors unleashed from the deep will fall entirely on the field agent.
    npc_mission_digging_proc_c_10: The client requests that any fieldwork is done
      carefully and avoids damaging any ancient architecture.

    planet_bounty_desc: |-
      They claim that their facility is subject to constant pirate harassment. It appears they have neither the means to defend themselves, nor the ability to leave their station.

      They offer a substantial reward to any who might bring this bombardment to an end...
    planet_scan_cre_desc: |-
      They claim to require detailed scans of the creatures who live on this planet. They have not been clear as to what they will do with this data.

      However, they have made it very clear that I will be rewarded handsomely should I assist them in collecting the data.
    planet_scan_min_desc: |-
      They claim to be in desperate need of detailed scans of the flora that grows in this system. They attempted to explain why, but their meaning was not clear.

      It is apparent that I will be rewarded handsomely should I assist them in collecting the data.
    planet_scan_tree_desc: |-
      Much of what they said was difficult to understand. It seems that they require geological data, probes of the minerals that litter this system.

      Despite the translation issues, one thing was clear: there is a substantial reward on offer for any explorer who supplies this data.
    planet_kill_robots_desc: They seemed possessed of a real anger, a hatred towards
      the Sentinels that swarm across their planet. The lifeform was unable to leave
      their post, but offered to reward me should I find and destroy Sentinel forces.
    planet_kill_fiends_desc: They seemed afraid, whispering incomprehensible warnings.
      I was able to understand only enough to know that they thought strange monstrosities
      were stalking their world, and that they would reward me should I find and kill
      these fiends.
    planet_kill_cre_desc: |-
      The lifeform seemed bored, tired of their life locked away inside their outpost. They mentioned something about the smell of mordite.

      The conversation was difficult to track, but they appear to want me to hunt for them. They offered a substantial reward should I venture out and kill the creatures that roam this world.
    planet_feed_cre_desc: |-
      They spoke to me of their love of the outside world, of how much it pained them to be locked away inside. They related some long and difficult to follow tale of a small creature that appeared to be their pet.

      They seem to be offering me a large reward should I wander the planet and feed any wild animals I come across.
    planet_digging_desc: |-
      They babbled excitedly, talking of some ancient ruin that showed great promise. They showed me their data, the clue that had put them on the trail of this artifact.

      They are not able to go looking for it themselves, so request that I do so on their behalf. They say I will be able to keep the artifact for myself, as long as I log any important historical discoveries in their name.
    planet_collect_desc: |-
      They seemed agitated, in great need of a particular substance. For reasons I do not understand, they are unable to leave their post to collect it for themselves.

      They have offered a generous reward should I collect it on their behalf and return it to their outpost.
    planet_deliver_desc: |-
      They have an item they claim needs delivering, but they are unable to make the journey themselves. They seem afraid of something, though I was not able to determine exactly what.

      They have offered a substantial reward should I successfully make the delivery on their behalf.
    planet_depot_desc: |-
      They babbled a set of coordinates, pointing excitedly at a map. They seem to have identified a resource depot. For reasons I did not understand, they seem excited at the prospect of this depot being destroyed.

      They offer me a generous payment should I destroy this depot for them.
    planet_raid_desc: |-
      They talked to me in serious tones, pointing out a nearby factory. Something about this installation has troubled them deeply, for it seems they want it raided.

      The lifeform offered a substantial reward should I infiltrate the facility and access its data banks. They warn me to expect the Sentinels to respond with force.
    planet_missing_desc: |-
      It was difficult to understand their exact meaning, but it seems as if a colleague of theirs has gone missing. They are distressed, and seek help in tracking them down.

      They offer me a large reward should I help them locate their missing 'friend'.

      their reaction. I shall have to complete their task to learn more.
    tra_planet_mission_res: The lifeform hops about, happy. They wave, as if to wish
      me good luck.
    war_planet_mission_res: The alien grunts at me, and makes an unimpressed gesture
      of thanks. They turn, almost as if they do not expect to see me again.
    npc_planet_mission_opt: Report success
    exp_planet_mission_done_res: The Korvax makes a gesture of thanks. They scan me
      briefly, making a note in their records. Bookkeeping complete, they present
      me with a reward.
    tra_planet_mission_done_res: The Gek chatters excitedly. They give me my reward,
      completing our deal.
    war_planet_mission_done_res: The Vy'keen salutes as I leave. I have gained their
      respect.

    fleet_mining_special_opt_b_15: Drill as deep as possible
    fleet_mining_special_res_a_15: I give the fleet commander specific instructions.
      The miners are to act with caution, taking measurements as they drill. Magma
      may be rich in minerals, but having it flood the tunnels is highly undesirable.
    fleet_mining_special_res_b_15: I tell the fleet commander to drill deep, to be
      a pioneer of the depths. There is much to be won, both in mineral wealth and

      %CAP_RACE%, it is good to see you. We entered %RACE% space, and began operations on planet %PLANET%. And now, I am faced with a dilemma. I need your advice.
      The deep-level mining team are refusing to dig any deeper. They have reached a strange fissure, and they believe they hear otherworldly voices. How should I proceed?

    fleet_mining_special_opt_b_18: Retreat
    fleet_mining_special_res_a_18: I tell the %CAP_RACE% to dig deeper. These 'voices'
      are likely just a release of pressurised gas.
    fleet_mining_special_res_b_18: I tell the %CAP_RACE% to withdraw their crew. Whatever
      dwells in the deep is not worth angering.
    fleet_mining_special_log_a_18: Crew heard strange whispers while mining deep in
      planet %PLANET%. Continued to dig after consulting the %CAP_RACE%. No further
      anomalies. Operation successful.
    fleet_mining_special_log_b_18: Crew heard strange whispers while mining deep in

      There will be many other opportunities on this voyage without bringing volatile
      nuclear fuel onboard.

      %CAP_RACE%, I hope this message find you well. The expedition is proceeding smoothly, and we have added many discoveries to our databank.
      The fleet is currently holding position in the %SYSTEM% Sector. Scans have detected an incredibly dense field of dark matter. We believe it would be possible to use this field as a wormhole.
      If you wish, we could calibrate the scanner to your signal. It may be possible to pull you directly to our position.
    fleet_explore_special_opt_a_2: Accept the warp

    fleet_explore_special_res_a_2: I tell the fleet commander to proceed. I look forward
      to seeing them soon.
    fleet_explore_special_res_b_2: I tell the fleet commander that though their science
      is impressive, I have no need of a cross-dimensional warp at this time. They
      look slightly relieved.
    fleet_explore_special_log_a_2: Encountered a dark matter field in the %SYSTEM%
      Sector. Used its gravitational well to open a wormhole for the %CAP_RACE% and
      transported them to our location.
    fleet_explore_special_log_b_2: Encountered a dark matter field in the %SYSTEM%

    fleet_explore_special_3: |-
      %CAP_RACE%, good news from the fleet. The expedition could not be going better.
      We are currently surveying the %SYSTEM% Sector. Scans have detected an exotic energy field distorting spacetime near our position.
      The engineers believe we can manipulate this energy field to act as a wormhole. It may be possible to pull you directly to our position.
    fleet_explore_special_res_a_3: The fleet commander seems very confident in this
      new warp technique. I accept their offer, and hope that confidence is well-placed.
    fleet_explore_special_res_b_3: I commend the fleet commander on their trust in
      their engineers. However, I decline to power my starship into this untested
      anomaly.
    fleet_explore_special_log_a_3: Encountered an exotic energy field in the %SYSTEM%
      Sector. Calibrated our warp engines to its resonance frequency to open a wormhole
      for the %CAP_RACE%. Successful transport.
    fleet_explore_special_log_b_3: Encountered an exotic energy field in the %SYSTEM%

      the Sentinels further. Their best chance is to flee, and as fast as they can.
    fleet_explore_special_log_a_9: Attacked by Sentinels while harvesting samples
      in the %SYSTEM% Sector. %CAP_RACE% travelled to our position and provided protection
      while the fleet fled the area.
    fleet_explore_special_log_b_9: Attacked by Sentinels while harvesting samples

      %CAP_RACE%, the expedition is at a standstill. We have encountered a strange object, and none of our equipment is returning comprehensible results.
      We are positioned near a metal sphere in deep space. Smaller than a space station, it is emitting highly unusual signals.
      It does not appear hostile. What should we do?
    fleet_explore_special_opt_a_10: Tell them to land
    fleet_explore_special_opt_b_10: Tell them to leave
    fleet_explore_special_res_a_10: I tell the fleet commander to assemble their best
      shuttle crew and attempt to land on or in the sphere. They agree, although they
      seem apprehensive.
    fleet_explore_special_res_b_10: I tell the fleet commander to leave the sphere
      be. Whatever - whoever - is responsible for it is unlikely to appreciate being
      poked at.
    fleet_explore_special_log_a_10: Encountered a perfect metal sphere floating in
      orbit around planet %PLANET%. Consulted the %CAP_RACE% before approaching. No
      records survived the approach, nor any crew memories. However, we found the
      hold full of gifts.

      %CAP_RACE%, the crew are in a dire situation.
      An expeditionary team was deployed to planet %PLANET%. They excavated a digsite, and found several jars of black water.
      For reasons unknown, the crew proceeded to drink the water. On return to the ship, they began to rant and rave.
      We have confined them to the medical bay, but I am unsure what our next steps should be...
    fleet_explore_special_opt_a_11: Keep them quarentineed
    fleet_explore_special_opt_b_11: Vent them into space
    fleet_explore_special_res_a_11: I tell the fleet commander to keep the affected
      crew in isolation, and to do everything in their power to treat them. If kept
      stable, they may recover.
    fleet_explore_special_res_b_11: The fleet commander reacts with surprise, but
      I insist. It is unfortunate, but they cannot take risks with the rest of the
      crew.
    fleet_explore_special_log_a_11: Crew drank strange black water found on planet
      %PLANET%. %CAP_RACE% advised a lengthy quarantine. With care, the crew recovered.
      They related tales of strange, otherworldly visions. Brain scans generated scientifically
      significant data.
    fleet_explore_special_log_b_11: Crew drank strange black water found on planet
      %PLANET%. %CAP_RACE% advised a lengthy quarantine. Crew experienced strange
      visions and were driven mad, destroying a large chunk of the medical bay before
      being subdued.
    fleet_explore_special_log_c_11: Crew drank strange black water found on planet
      %PLANET%. %CAP_RACE% advised the crew were compromised, and to jettision them
      into space. Did so, with regret.
    fleet_explore_special_12: |-
      %CAP_RACE%, I am afraid I must report an emergency,
      A geological research team was deployed to an interesting cave system on planet %PLANET%. During their research, they disturbed a fumarole. The gas that spewed from the vent did not match any known substance. The crew immediately evacuated.
      On their return, crew who inhaled the gas began reporting strange symptoms. Their eyes are bloodshot, and their skin has begun to glow. I have quarantined those affected, but am unsure what to do next.
    fleet_explore_special_opt_a_12: Return them to the planet
    fleet_explore_special_opt_b_12: Treat with targeted radiation
    fleet_explore_special_res_a_12: I tell the fleet commander to return the infected
      crew to the planet's surface. They cannot risk the lives of all onboard.
    fleet_explore_special_res_b_12: I tell the fleet commander to fight fire with
      fire. Treat the infected crew with targeted radiation beams, and burn out whatever
      mutation has stricken them.
    fleet_explore_special_log_a_12: Crew inhaled strange gas on planet %PLANET%. On
      advice of the %CAP_RACE%, left infected crew planetside and surveyed from orbit.
      Crew developed remarkable abilities, and appeared unaffected by the toxic atmosphere.
      Isolated the mutation for further study.
    fleet_explore_special_log_b_12: Crew inhaled strange gas on planet %PLANET%. On
      advice of the %CAP_RACE%, left infected crew planetside and surveyed from orbit.
      Crew became rapidly ill and died.
    fleet_explore_special_log_c_12: Crew inhaled strange gas on planet %PLANET%. On

      %CAP_RACE%, I have news of an opportunity in the %SYSTEM% Sector.
      The fleet has encountered a black hole. Spin conditions and relative mass indicate the hole may be suitable for long-distance travel.
      The potential for discovery is significant. Nonetheless, I cannot risk the fleet without your approval. Should we proceed?
    fleet_explore_special_opt_a_13: Enter the black hole
    fleet_explore_special_opt_b_13: Avoid it
    fleet_explore_special_res_a_13: I give the go-ahead to the slightly apprehensive
      fleet commander. I reassure them, telling them to trust the calculations of
      their engineers and to look forward to the strange sights that surely await
      them on the other side.
    fleet_explore_special_res_b_13: I tell the fleet commander to avoid the black
      hole. Local space is barely mapped. There is plenty to discover without risking
      lives in a gravitational anomaly.
    fleet_explore_special_log_a_13: Entered a black hole in the %SYSTEM% Sector. Passed
      through thousands of systems in the blink of an eye, harvesting data on countless
      wonders. All ships left the wormhole at the correct moment and safely returned
      to conventional spacetime.
    fleet_explore_special_log_b_13: Entered a black hole in the %SYSTEM% Sector. Minor
      error in approach angle caused the wormhole to scatter the fleet across several
      systems. Considerable fuel expended reuniting the fleet. Significant gravitational
      damage.
    fleet_explore_special_log_c_13: Encountered a black hole in the %SYSTEM% Sector.
      Some wormhole potential exhibited. Took measurements from afar but on advice
      from the %CAP_RACE% did not approach the event horizon.

    fleet_explore_special_opt_a_14: Deploy the crew
    fleet_explore_special_opt_b_14: Avoid the planet
    fleet_explore_special_res_a_14: I tell the fleet commander to proceed. Every planetary
      expedition carries risk, but few planets seem as interesting as this one.
    fleet_explore_special_res_b_14: I tell the fleet commander to stand their crew
      down. Anomalies such as this are not to be trifled with. The fleet commander
      seems relieved.
    fleet_explore_special_log_a_14: Discovered a metallic planet in the %SYSTEM% System,

      Greetings from the %SYSTEM% System, %CAP_RACE%. I have unfortunate news.
      Several of the crew have taken ill after visiting planet %PLANET%. Feverous and cramping, they appear to be in great pain.
      The crew report seeing creatures with these symptoms on the planet surface, presumably the source of this outbreak.
      I have confined affected crew to the medical bay, but it appears highly contagious. What should we do?
    fleet_explore_special_opt_a_15: Capture infected creatures
    fleet_explore_special_opt_b_15: Sedate affected crew
    fleet_explore_special_res_a_15: I tell the fleet commander to send another expedition
      down to the surface. If they can capture one of the infected creatures, they
      might be able to synthesise a cure.
    fleet_explore_special_res_b_15: I tell %NAME% to keep the infected crew sedated,
      and to lock down the medical bay. They must prevent the infection spreading
      at all costs.
    fleet_explore_special_log_a_15: Ground crew became infected after coming into
      contact with local fauna on planet %PLANET%. On advice of the %CAP_RACE%, confined
      the crew to the medical bay. Infection did not spread, but fatality rate among
      affected crew was 90%.

      %CAP_RACE%, I require your advice.
      The crew investigated a crashed freighter on planet %PLANET%. They found nothing of note, but have been complaining of strange happenings on board the ship ever since.
      Moved items, strange whispers, unexplained equipment failure. No-one has been harmed, but the crew are becoming nervous and difficult to manage.
    fleet_explore_special_opt_a_16: Research the activity
    fleet_explore_special_opt_b_16: Tell the crew to ignore it.
    fleet_explore_special_res_a_16: I tell the fleet commander to make the strange
      goings on a focus of their research. The paranormal is often a sign of some
      new discoveries waiting to be made.
    fleet_explore_special_res_b_16: I tell the fleet commander to get a grip on their
      crew. Strange noises and the occasional steam explosion are all part of normal
      life on a starship, and are nothing to fear.
    fleet_explore_special_log_a_16: Crew became fearful of suspected paranormal activity
      while crossing the %SYSTEM% Sector. Investigated source of 'outbreak' and found
      previously unrecorded species of space-rodent living in the engine pipes. Profitable
      discovery made; damage to pipes avoided.
    fleet_explore_special_log_b_16: Crew became fearful of suspected paranormal activity

      A high-intensity gamma burst has overwhelmed the fleet's protective fields while surveying the %SYSTEM% System! Core components are overheating, and we will not be able to contain them much longer!
      We must shut down vital systems while we recovery, but each poses unacceptable risks. What should we do?
    fleet_explore_special_opt_a_19: Shut down engines

      %CAP_RACE%, I report a discovery in the %SYSTEM% System.
      Botanists exploring planet %PLANET% discovered a tree with an irresistible-smelling fruit. Clearly, it desires we consume it.
      However, to simply obey a random plant would be madness. We must test this fruit first. The question is, how?
    fleet_explore_special_opt_a_20: Test on crew
    fleet_explore_special_opt_b_20: Test on creatures
    fleet_explore_special_opt_c_20: Test with equipment

      the fruit, though to start with the more expendable crew.
    fleet_explore_special_res_b_20: I tell the fleet commander to feed the fruit to
      creatures from nearby planets. They will have evolved alongside it, and may
      offer some useful data.
    fleet_explore_special_res_c_20: I remind the fleet commander that they head a
      well-equipped research fleet. They have ample lab facilities to fully test the
      fruit without just eating it.
    fleet_explore_special_res_d_20: I tell the fleet commander to dispose of the fruit
      immediately. Nothing good can come it.
    fleet_explore_special_log_a_20: Collected irresistible-smelling fruit on planet
      %PLANET%. Took advice from the %CAP_RACE% and fed the fruit to the crew. Seeds
      germinated within their stomachs. Plant rapidly grew and consumed them from
      the inside.
    fleet_explore_special_log_b_20: Collected irresistible-smelling fruit on planet

      crew report space station abandoned. Uncontrolled nanite expansion observed.
      Crew quarantined.
    fleet_explore_fail_19: Signal beacons reveal local space to be Korvax-controlled.
      No shell entities observed, either in station or planetside. Suggest Convergence
      presence without physical embodiment.
    fleet_explore_fail_20: Approached Vy'keen station. No living beings found. Many
      dead Vy'keen discovered. On-site testing suggests violence when station crew
      turned on each other.
    fleet_explore_fail_21: Planetside expeditionary team excavated promising site.
      Nothing found but dust and bones. Bone testing revealed little of interest.
    fleet_explore_fail_22: Archaeological crew located subterranean ruins. Excavation
      revealed crate after crate of decomposed foodstuffs. Mould appear to have few
      promising medicinal uses. Site abandoned.
    fleet_explore_fail_23: Surface team explored large cave system. Highly radioactive
      water source found. No suggestion of life within the water. Abandoned exploration
      before dose reached hazardous levels.

      revealed samples to be tissue and hair from station rats. Samples recategorised
      'Not Significant'.
    fleet_explore_fail_27: Sold several crates of mineral samples by local geographical
      institute. Despite agent's assurances, samples turned out to be common rocks.
      On return to the institute, found building abandoned.
    fleet_explore_fail_28: Surface team given tip-off from locals. Attempted to track
      down inland sea with reportedly miraculous properties. Orbital survey revealed
      no such sea existed.
    fleet_explore_fail_29: Interviewed local lifeforms for clues about sites of archaeological
      interest. Directions given were confused and self-contradictory. Surface team
      spent several days pursuing leads to no success.
    fleet_explore_fail_30: Surface team scanned items at local trade outpost and discovered
      anomalous readings. Returned with hauler crew to extract samples, but found
      no trace of an outpost at the logged coordinates.
    fleet_explore_damage_1: Fleet experienced severe warp vibration. Resonance grew
      audible, crew in some level of distress. Vibration significant enough to cause
      severe damage to internal systems.
    fleet_explore_damage_2: Hyperdrive navigation error resulted in dropping out of
      warp too close to binary pair. Fleet suffered extreme heat damage. Internal
      systems affected.
    fleet_explore_damage_3: Collected Sentinel effigies from Vy'keen systems. Effigies
      became active in hold, exhibiting Sentinel-like behaviour. Internal security
      destroyed the effigies, but not without severe damage to ship systems.
    fleet_explore_damage_4: Laboratory crew performed anomaly-detection experiment.
      Equipment malfunction lead to the generation of thousands of miniature black
      holes within vital ship systems.
    fleet_explore_damage_5: No activity on long-range scanner. Crew performed maintenance
      on experimental impulse reactor. Subset of maintenance crew fell into the reactor,
      causing severe damage to both parties.
    fleet_explore_damage_6: Approached anomalous metallic orb. Orb unleashed what
      appeared to be advanced laser weaponry before vanishing. Severe damage to internal
      systems.
    fleet_explore_damage_7: Promising hybrid candidate found on planet and returned
      to the lab. Genetic manipulation overly successful. Creatures escaped, multiplied,
      and ate their way through miles of important wiring.
    fleet_explore_damage_8: Mined experimental fuel substance from nearby planet.
      Fuel was distilled and applied to engine. Results were explosive. Severe internal
      damage sustained.
    fleet_explore_damage_9: Attempted to take readings within stellar magnetic field.
      Fleet caught in a large and violent plasma eruption. High degree of damage suffered
      across multiple core systems.
    fleet_explore_damage_10: Captured dangerous predatory creature. Lab containment

      but not before consuming several researchers and a considerable amount of important
      circuitry.
    fleet_explore_damage_11: Recovered alien technology from archaeological dig. Attempted
      to install technology. Interface proved possible but ill-advised. Dangerous
      electronic discharge routed through core ship systems.
    fleet_explore_damage_12: Deployed scanners to analyse anomalous computer systems
      found in an abandoned base. Data link allowed hostile code to install on fleet
      computers. Several modules burned out or self-destructed before systems could
      be cleansed.
    fleet_explore_damage_13: Approached anomalous moon. Temperature readings rapidly
      oscillated between extreme heat and extreme cold. Fleet caught on a temperature
      boundary as the anomaly shifted. Multiple core systems damage in flash-freeze
      event.
    fleet_explore_damage_14: Sensors detected unusual stellar activity. Activated
      magnetic shielding and moved into position to take observations. Experienced
      solar flare of unprecedented magnitude. Electromagnetic surge disabled or destroyed
      numerous critical systems.
    fleet_explore_damage_15: Tracing faint but anomalous radio signal. Detector gain
      set to maximum level. Overwhelmed by sudden surge. Bridge circuitry blown. High
      damage to internal wiring.
    fleet_explore_damage_16: Extreme gravitational event detected. Gyroscopic stabilisers
      deployed. Unable to manoeuvre fleet to avoid gravitational wave damage. Several
      hull breaches detected.

      sequence. Spacetime rupture detected. Several components relocated relative
      to each other. Severe damage to ship internals. Minor hull breaches.
    fleet_explore_damage_18: Took aboard berry samples from local planet. Conducted
      lab tests. Fruits proved highly combustible. Multiple bulkheads consumed by
      fire. Water damage sustained across entire ship during firefighting efforts.
    fleet_explore_damage_19: Collected atmosphere samples from several systems. Catalogue
      isolation failed and atmospheres were permitted to mix. Hazardous reaction caused
      highly acidic clouds to billow throughout the ship. Several corrosion damage
      sustained.
    fleet_explore_damage_20: Approach Vy'keen warship. Deployed scanners in attempt
      to better understand Vy'keen culture. Action was interpreted as hostile, target
      ship opened fire. Sustained significant hull damage.
    fleet_explore_damage_21: Discovered planet largely composed of hexagons. Took
      water sample. Laboratory crew exposed to 'water' developed maddening rage; tore
      each other to shreds. Delicate ship components damaged as crew flailed about.
    fleet_explore_damage_22: Alarms sounded as expedition came out of warp. Diagnostics
      indicated not all ship components left hyperspace simultaneously. Severe damage
      sustained as ship briefly split and recombined. Hull stable.
    fleet_explore_damage_23: 'Warp tunnel navigation failure. Expedition path too
      close to black hole. Event horizon avoided, but some spaghettification experienced.
      Hull suffered thousands of minor breaches. Cumulative effect: catastrophic damage.'
    fleet_explore_damage_24: Approached by Korvax vessel. Attempted data exchange
      in the spirit of furthering universal knowledge. Vessel was hostile, fleet computers
      hacked. Weapons systems discharged internally, severe damage to pressure hull.
    fleet_explore_damage_25: Nanite foam acquired from abandoned planetary building.
      When introduced to fuel jelly, nanite foam expanded rapidly. Onboard laboratory
      subsumed. Outbreak contained, but starship core partially liquidised.

      only of your return from wild atmospheres. Share every detail!
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_done_15: Our time is very close, now, friend. Your data would
      be a comfort... remind us of the vastness of space, of life...
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_done_16: Friend...
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_res_a_1: "Polo pores over the data, muttering bitterly at variations
      they are already familiar with, cheering at those they are not. \n\nFinally
      Polo applauds wildly, and offers to craft me a new technology. They claim that
      we are now bonded in 'glorious friendship'."
    tra_npc_anomaly_res_a_2: The Gek runs an instrument over my head, their hands
      trembling with excitement. Polo then turns to fiddle with their arcane machinery,
      offering me another choice of technology.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_res_a_3: |-
      Polo analyses the trading logs from my ship and my exosuit, creating an incomprehensible graph from the results. They laugh as if at a shared joke.

      Polo tells me that their fellow Gek are the most foolish species of all. Money is not real. Nothing is real. They tell me that only friendship matters, offering me the gift of a new technology in demonstration.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_res_a_4: |-
      Polo seems upset at the data I send through. They do not understand why all of this killing, all of this bloodshed was necessary.

      They suggest that perhaps they will never understand. They offer me a technology, turning away from my sight. It is unclear if they blame me for what I have had to do.
    tra_npc_anomaly_res_a_5: Though Polo tries to appear aloof, their eyes blaze with
      relief at the sight of me. They still care, then. A small smile accompanies
      my compensation for the Sentinel data.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_res_a_6: "Polo seems unconvinced by my claims of longevity,
      wondering aloud if I am some Sentinel-made replica. \n\nThey check me over thoroughly,
      then offer a huge grin. They seem excited about whatever they have discovered,
      offering me the gift of new technology."
    tra_npc_anomaly_res_a_7: Before taking the Warp data, Polo gazes deep into my
      eyes, trying to discern if I am changed by my long travels. They release a wistful
      sigh, and then offer a new technology.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_res_a_8: |-
      With infectious enthusiasm, Polo browses the creature scans, and we find ourselves cooing and laughing together at some of the stranger species.

      They offer me a technology of their own design. Polo says that they have no more use for it...
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_res_a_9: |-
      Polo stares at length at the images of each species, watching their movements and listening to their words. Every lifeform that shows the slightest individuality appears to have something wrong with them, some sickness within.

      They offer me my reward with a subtle sadness, claiming there are no new friends to be found. They begin to cough.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_res_a_10: |-
      I present the proof of my linguistic advancement. Polo bursts into tears.

      They say they wish I remembered my old life, our old times together. I ask Polo what they mean, but they claim they cannot talk about it.
      They claim that they have said too much, and return to their standard offer of new technology.
    tra_npc_anomaly_res_a_11: Polo does not even ask for my research data this time.
      The Gek simply congratulates me for my success and then offers me a gift. I
      am none the wiser.
    tra_npc_anomaly_res_a_12: |-
      There is mingled guilt and relief in the Gek's bright eyes as they hand me another blueprint. Whether or not their intentions are honest, Polo does not want to see me harmed.
      They offer to create me a new piece of technology, to protect me on my travels.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_res_a_13: |-
      Polo silently bundles me into a hug when I return, and this time I do not recoil. I do not ask why, either. There are tears in the Gek's eyes.
      They thank me for saving their lives, however brief the respite.
      Polo turns to their machinery, hoping to craft me something in thanks.
    tra_npc_anomaly_res_a_14: |-
      Polo is rapt with envy as I recount tales of the monstrous climates I have endured, of horrendous travels through burning rain and choking heat. What peculiar jealousy.
      They feel inspired to create some new technological marvel, and offer me the results.
    tra_npc_u3anomaly_res_a_15: Polo tells me that they are glad I have seen so much
      with my own eyes. Wonder is a rare but dangerous gift. Polo gives me a new piece
      of technology to light my way...
    tra_npc_anomaly_res_a_16: |-
      Polo puts the data to one side and turns to the window. For a time, we watch the stars together, my friend and I. We clasp hands, and then I go to leave. There is more to see.
      Polo stops me. Although the gift barely matters, the Gek does not want to break our pattern. The nod at me, and at their machinery.

      caused. Some new task will refresh us both, yes?
    tra_npc_wait_link_7: All those systems, those stars, such time spent between worlds,
      living in the light...your warp data was fascinating, friend! Shall we continue
      our work together?
    tra_npc_wait_link_8: The animals you found me were a real comfort, friend. Their

      But it is time for some new work, yes?
    ui_u4_traveller_log_1: |-
      We sought an escape from reality. That’s why we’re all here, isn’t it?

      I can remember what it was like, to be a Traveller. To have that hope, that intolerable thirst for the new...

      I should never have listened to you, my love. There is no fire in this place, no trophies fit for gods. There is only darkness. The family of glass, they watch everything...
    ui_u4_traveller_log_2: |-
      Did it know what I had done to it? Was it angry? Upset? Alone? Afraid? Could a Sentinel feel such things?

      It hovered before me, its light catching upon a thousand crystal shards all around. And as I moved on, it travelled by my side.

      That night I dreamt of the warp cage, but there was no more pain within. The drone looked at me, and I knew that I had been forgiven. I had fixed it. I had answered for my sin.

      I shall call it Laylaps.
    ui_u4_traveller_log_3: |-
      We see the Sentinels swarm across the void, warping in and out of this dimension at the will of some unknown force, depositing the echoes of the dead within the archives.

      Laylaps does not join the others. It just stares at me, its light still shining unaltered, unabated. It is a comfort to me.
    ui_u4_traveller_log_4: |-
      I found them standing over me as I awoke, their beak chattering, their eyes caught between horror and joy.

      It was the tallest Gek I had ever seen, but the mystery was soon solved. They asked me of the Empire – they wanted to know if the First Spawn still spoke their name. In life they had possessed a hundred Korvax slaves, you see.
      They do not remember how they arrived in this place. Their face swarms with nanites. They are lonely.
    ui_u4_traveller_log_5: |-
      The three of us journeyed to the centre: the Sentinel, the First Spawn, and the Traveller, all children of the ATLAS, all hoping for some answer in the void.

      The First Spawn would not stop talking, would not stop glorifying their cruel life of brutality and pain. One night they sang a song, a tale of a lost people, of an armada of freighters fleeing the abyss.

      Of a world where every Sentinel turned against every living thing, annihilating them all within moments. Laylaps showed no sign of understanding. It did not leave us, nor did it try and explain.

      Perhaps the Sentinels were right.
    ui_u4_traveller_log_6: |-
      The First Spawn fought valiantly, but there was no saving them. The nanites had found their place within, protruding outward through every pore, through every limb and every thought.

      And it was done. They departed with the family of glass, forever lost to this world, their story at an end.

      I ventured on. We were almost there.
    ui_u4_traveller_log_7: |-
      Something was very wrong. The ATLAS interface had grown still, its orb cold and almost grey. The computers did not respond. Nothing did.

      It took a few moments before I realised that Laylaps was gone.

      I was alone.
    ui_u4_traveller_log_8: |-
      I heard the music again this morning – that same signal that led me to this realm. I stood and listened, honing my instruments to find the source, expecting some different result, but what use was science here?

      If a computer is on fire, what good are the prayers of data?
    ui_u4_traveller_log_9: |-
      They had captured my friend. I saw them from a distance, the family of glass in all their majesty, cradling the fallen Sentinel, its light flickering in their awful embrace.

      I let out an involuntary cry as they cut into its exoskeleton, and each vacant stare, each grin of malice turned to me.

      I fled, but it was no use. They numbered in the hundreds. They found me.
    ui_u4_traveller_log_10: "It was Laylaps - Laylaps who I had doubted, Laylaps who
      I had harmed and fixed, Laylaps who was my salvation! It tore us both from that
      awful place, warping us back to the universe, to our universe!\n\nThe first
      Traveller in history to escape the World of Glass, to be reclaimed from death
      itself! It is kindness that saves us all, don’t you think? Laylaps told me everything,
      speaking through my very exosuit! \n\nI will see you soon, my friend. Together
      at last! What tales they will tell of us! I am transmitting the glyphs now.
      I can’t wait for you to meet my new friends..."

    all_trader_trade_desc_1: Although I cannot be sure of their precise meaning, this
      trader appears keen to do business.
    all_trader_trade_desc_2: The trader gestures happily, pleased to have made contact
      with a fellow spacefarer.
    all_trader_trade_desc_3: The pilot indicates they wish to trade, but they seem
      cautious. Eventually they relax, and prepare their manifest.
    all_trader_trade_desc_4: The pilot jabbers at me, excited to have made contact
      with another trader.
    all_trader_trade_desc_5: Even before I speak, the pilot has already prepared their
      cargo manifest. They seem keen to do a deal.
    all_trader_trade_desc_6: The pilot prepares their trading systems. Their cargo
      is ready for inspection.
    all_trader_trade_desc_7: The trader examines my cargo data. They try to appear
      calm, but they do a poor job. They cannot hide just how keen they are to do
      a deal.
    all_trader_trade_desc_8: The pilot chatters away, thrilled. They appear to have
      been travelling through space for a long time, cut off from normal conversation.
    all_trader_trade_desc_9: The trader gestures happily, keen to do business directly,
      free from the interference and regulation of the Galactic Trade Terminals.
    all_trader_trade_desc_10: Although their speech is garbled and confusing, the
      pilot's meaning is clear. They speak in the universal language of money.
    all_trader_trade_opt_a: Examine cargo manifest
    all_trader_trade_opt_b: End communication
    all_trader_trade_opt_a_alt: Buy products

    all_trader_trade_res_b_1: To the disappointment of the trader, I decline to inspect
      their goods.
    all_trader_trade_res_b_2: I have little need of trade at the moment, and decline
      the chance to browse the pilot's wares.
    all_trader_trade_res_b_3: This trader looks as if they have little to offer. I
      would do better to trade elsewhere.
    dnt_exp_trader_offload_lang_1: Hmm. Cargo not only valuable - also holy to Korvax
      Convergence. Unknown entity will respect?
    dnt_exp_trader_offload_lang_2: Such rare findings at echo monolith! Lifeform permitted
      to purchase - for research only.
    dnt_exp_trader_offload_lang_3: Analysis of curiosities is complete. Organic entity
      wishes to research too? Can offer trade.
    dnt_tra_trader_offload_lang_1: Found such loot in ancient vaults! Friend would
      not believe! One time opportunity!
    dnt_tra_trader_offload_lang_2: Prosperous journey, friend! Discovered rare exotic
      products! Not available at planetary market!
    dnt_tra_trader_offload_lang_3: Discovered exciting stockpile in ruined location!
      Want to trade, friend?
    dnt_war_trader_offload_lang_1: Grah! Very ancient treasure in ship! Demand large
      offer to trade!
    dnt_war_trader_offload_lang_2: Found pointless ancient material. No use to warrior.
      Interloper make offer?
    dnt_war_trader_offload_lang_3: Interloper interested in Vy'keen treasure? Look
      with respect.
    all_trader_offload_desc_1: Excited to see another pilot, the trader offers me
      one of their collection of rare and precious items.
    all_trader_offload_desc_2: The pilot seems like a normal trader, but instead of
      the usual range of goods, they carry only trinkets and curios. I wonder what
      lead to such an unusual cargo...
    all_trader_offload_desc_3: This trader doesn't speak like the other merchants
      I've met. They appear to be a specialist, carrying only the most unusual items...
    all_trader_offload_desc_4: I do not know exactly who this pilot is. A trader?
      A historian? A grave robber? Either way, they appear to be peddling trinkets.
    all_trader_offload_desc_5: The trader transmits their cargo manifest, revealing
      a strange collection. Their hold is full of relics, items of importance to their
      people. They appear willing to part with them...
    all_trader_offload_opt_a: Bargain for Relic
    all_trader_offload_opt_d: Decline
    all_trader_offload_res_a_1: I accept the trader's offer. I'm sure I will find
      a use for this relic, or it will find a use for me...
    all_trader_offload_res_a_2: The relic is worth the asking price. Even if I am
      unsure what exactly it's for, these items are highly valued by the people who
      live in this system.
    all_trader_offload_res_a_3: The trader sends me the relic and leaves, happy to
      have spread whatever it is they think they're spreading.
    all_trader_offload_res_b_1: I decline the trader's strange collection of trinkets.
    all_trader_offload_res_b_2: I thank the trader for their offer, but decline to
      take one of their relics.
    all_trader_offload_res_b_3: I have no need of the merchant's relics right now.
      I thank them for the offer, and end the communication.

    all_trader_repair_opt_a: Offer to Repair
    all_trader_repair_opt_d: Decline
    all_trader_repair_res_a_1: The lifeform's eyes widen with gratitude. They give

      me what they can spare before departing to repair their ship.

    dnt_exp_tguild_greet_unknown_1: Apologies, probable customer entity. Purchase
      unavailable at this station.
    dnt_tra_tguild_greet_unknown_1: Merchants Guild trade is only available to registered
      members. Seek business elsewhere.
    dnt_war_tguild_greet_unknown_1: Grah! Interloper must prove trade skill before
      worthy of Merchants Guild time!
    dnt_exp_tguild_greet_low_1: Greetings. Guild discount is not available to low
      rank members, sorry.
    dnt_tra_tguild_greet_low_1: Welcome, initiate trader! Have you brought much to
      sell?
    dnt_war_tguild_greet_low_1: Greetings, pathetic initiate.
    dnt_exp_tguild_greet_med_1: Hello, merchant entity. Trade success to report?
    dnt_tra_tguild_greet_med_1: Greetings, friend in trades. We hope bargains always
      find you.
    dnt_war_tguild_greet_med_1: Grah! Interloper trade strength is improving. Good.
    dnt_exp_tguild_greet_high_1: Ah. Recognised trade entity. This shell is at your
      service.
    dnt_tra_tguild_greet_high_1: Welcome! Merchants speak of your trade skills, friend.
    dnt_war_tguild_greet_high_1: Interloper has well-earned triumph in trade. Welcome.
    dnt_exp_tguild_greet_best_1: 'Entity trade intelligence: high. Guild: pleased.'
    dnt_tra_tguild_greet_best_1: I cower before you, Trade Lord.
    dnt_war_tguild_greet_best_1: I salute your strength in trade, interloper!
    dnt_exp_eguild_greet_unknown_1: Unknown entity is irrelevance to Guild of Explorers.
      Goodbye.
    dnt_tra_eguild_greet_unknown_1: Explorers Guild has not discovered maybe-friend.
      No time to spend on you!
    dnt_war_eguild_greet_unknown_1: Grah! Explorers Guild has no knowledge of interloper!
      Goodbye!
    dnt_exp_eguild_greet_low_1: Welcome, apprentice. Have you discovered much?
    dnt_tra_eguild_greet_low_1: Hello, apprentice friend. How much universe have you
      discovered?
    dnt_war_eguild_greet_low_1: Grah! Interloper is still apprentice! Stop talk, journey
      further!
    dnt_exp_eguild_greet_med_1: Greetings, seeker entity. May the creatures be great
      and the plants many.
    dnt_tra_eguild_greet_med_1: Hello, fellow member. Many new systems in your logs?
    dnt_war_eguild_greet_med_1: Greetings, interloper. Seek, journey, interlope further.
    dnt_exp_eguild_greet_high_1: Superior seeker is acknowledged by Explorers Guild.
      Greetings.
    dnt_tra_eguild_greet_high_1: Your logs impress the Explorers Guild, friend!
    dnt_war_eguild_greet_high_1: Interloper has impressed in battle for knowledge.
    dnt_exp_eguild_greet_best_1: Excellent navigational record. High value to Explorers
      Guild.
    dnt_tra_eguild_greet_best_1: Friend is rich in knowledge! So much research logged!
    dnt_war_eguild_greet_best_1: I salute you and your wisdom! Grah!
    dnt_exp_wguild_greet_unknown_1: Hmm. Entity is unknown to Mercenaries Guild. Respect
      impossible at this time.
    dnt_tra_wguild_greet_unknown_1: Who are you, maybe-friend? Strong spawn or weak?
      Mercenaries Guild does not know.
    dnt_war_wguild_greet_unknown_1: Grah! Mercenaries Guild has no respect for unknown
      interloper. Prove strength before you return.
    dnt_exp_wguild_greet_low_1: Greetings, apprentice in violence. Combat score is
      improving.
    dnt_tra_wguild_greet_low_1: Your death scent is still weak, new friend. Be quick
      here.
    dnt_war_wguild_greet_low_1: How is your body count, warrior apprentice? Improving?
    dnt_exp_wguild_greet_med_1: The Mercenaries Guild welcomes you, entity of combat.
    dnt_tra_wguild_greet_med_1: Welcome, fellow merchant of death. Enjoy much luck
      in war!
    dnt_war_wguild_greet_med_1: Interloper demonstrates increase in strength. Could
      soon be great warrior. Grah!
    dnt_exp_wguild_greet_high_1: Biological entity is performing well with weaponry.
      Commendable.
    dnt_tra_wguild_greet_high_1: Hello, friend in death! Fight hard, take loot, drink
      rival blood!
    dnt_war_wguild_greet_high_1: Death! Death! Death! Interloper has slain many foes!
    dnt_exp_wguild_greet_best_1: Greetings, superior rank member.
    dnt_tra_wguild_greet_best_1: Welcome, admired friend!
    dnt_war_wguild_greet_best_1: I salute you, supreme commander!
    npc_tguild_greet_unknown_desc_1: |-
      Though their words are unclear, the badge on the lifeform's uniform is unmistakable. They are an envoy of the Merchant's Guild.
      They do not seem particularly interested in trading with me, however.
    npc_tguild_greet_unknown_desc_2: |-
      I have seen this alien's insignia before. They are a member of the Merchants Guild.
      They do not seem to have any business for me at the moment. Perhaps the <SPECIAL>Mission Listings Agent<> on the station might have a way to prove my worth?
    npc_tguild_greet_low_desc_1: I recognise this alien as a fellow trader, another
      member of the Merchants Guild.
    npc_tguild_greet_low_desc_2: Their keen mercantile eyes give this lifeform away
      as a member of the Merchants Guild, a fellow trader looking to make their way
      in the galaxy.
    npc_tguild_greet_low_desc_3: The lifeform bows gently, more in ritual than respect.
      They flash their badge, revealing themselves as the Merchants Guild representative
      in this system.
    npc_tguild_greet_med_desc_1: The alien, who appears to be the Merchant Guild envoy
      in this system, scanned me subtly as I approached. Having seen my rank with
      the Guild, they apologise for the intrusion and greet me with warmth.
    npc_tguild_greet_med_desc_2: |-
      The alien transmits a short data sequence, revealing themselves as the Merchants Guild's official representative in this system.
      Despite their apparent friendliness, I cannot help but think they are assessing me, working out how to best me in a deal.
    npc_tguild_greet_med_desc_3: The lifeform nods at me. I do not believe I have
      met them before, but they clearly recognise me. They must be the Merchants Guild
      representative in this system.
    npc_tguild_greet_high_desc_1: The alien greets me warmly. They work for the Merchants
      Guild, keeping an eye on business in this system. They have a message to relay.
    npc_tguild_greet_high_desc_2: The lifeform identifies themself as the Merchants
      Guild representative in this system. We perform the mutual exchange of units
      that Guild protocol demands.
    npc_tguild_greet_high_desc_3: The lifeform shows their identification, the badge
      of a middle-ranking envoy of the Merchants Guild. They bow, pleased to have
      me visit their system.
    npc_tguild_greet_best_desc_1: The lifeform, an envoy of the Merchants Guild, seems
      excited to see me. They give a short, hesitant gesture, as if apologising for
      the lack of wealth and status in their system.
    npc_tguild_greet_best_desc_2: The alien jabbers excitedly, transmitting a sequence
      of recent profitable deals. They are the Merchants Guild envoy in this system,
      and keen to impress.
    npc_tguild_greet_best_desc_3: The lifeform greets me as a high-ranking member
      of the Merchants Guild, performing the special gestures required at such a meeting.
    npc_eguild_greet_unknown_desc_1: |-
      The lifeform carries both the badge of the Explorers Guild and the worldly pose of one who has broken ground on many strange planets.
      For a supposedly curious lifeform, I do not seem to provoked much interest. Perhaps they deem me unworthy of study.
    npc_eguild_greet_unknown_desc_2: |-
      I have seen this alien's insignia before. They are a member of the Explorers Guild.
      They do not seem interested in the data I have to offer. Perhaps the <SPECIAL>Mission Listings Agent<> on the station might have a way to prove my worth?
    npc_eguild_greet_low_desc_1: The lifeform examines me before revealing their credentials
      as a member of the Explorers Guild.
    npc_eguild_greet_low_desc_2: The alien reveals themselves as an envoy of the Explorers
      Guild. They appear to be assessing me, but to what end? To learn my worth as
      an explorer, or simply as an object of curiosity?
    npc_eguild_greet_low_desc_3: The lifeform presents their Explorers Guild credentials,
      showing themselves as the official envoy for this system. For some reason, they
      also transmit a detailed record of every plant they've ever discovered.
    npc_eguild_greet_med_desc_1: The lifeform flashes a small holographic display,
      a 3D token of their status as the Explorers Guild envoy in this system.
    npc_eguild_greet_med_desc_2: The alien reveals their Explorers Guild credentials,
      the paperwork of an official envoy.
    npc_eguild_greet_med_desc_3: The lifeform shows their identification as an official
      of the Explorers Guild, but not before attempting to scan me for data.
    npc_eguild_greet_high_desc_1: The lifeform jabbers excitedly, happy to share their
      latest research with a fellow member of the Explorer's Guild.
    npc_eguild_greet_high_desc_2: The alien reveals themselves as an explorer of some
      standing with the Guild. They welcome me to their system.
    npc_eguild_greet_high_desc_3: The lifeform greets me warmly, revealing themselves
      as the Explorers Guild's leading researcher in this system.
    npc_eguild_greet_best_desc_1: The lifeform subjects me to a brief analysis before
      bowing deeply. They are the official Explorers Guild representative in this
      system.
    npc_eguild_greet_best_desc_2: The alien greets me with a selection of interesting
      images taken in this system. As the Explorers Guild envoy here, they are keen
      that I see the sights.
    npc_eguild_greet_best_desc_3: The lifeform scans me, scans themselves, and finally
      scans the Explorers Guild insignia they have projected in front of them. The
      ritual over, they bow before me.
    npc_wguild_greet_unknown_desc_1: The alien's aggressive tone and rough demeanor
      mark them out as a mercenary. I hope they are here in some official capacity,
      rather than undertaking a mission.
    npc_wguild_greet_unknown_desc_2: |-
      The lifeform glares at me briefly, shaking their head. They seem to be a representative of the Guild of Mercenaries.
      Perhaps I could impress them by undertaking work from the <SPECIAL>Mission Listings Agent<>?
    npc_wguild_greet_low_desc_1: The alien gives a terse salute. Their insignia is
      of a middle-ranking officer of the Mercenaries Guild.
    npc_wguild_greet_low_desc_2: The lifeform barks at me in a grumpy tone. Their
      badge shows them as an envoy of the Mercenaries Guild.
    npc_wguild_greet_low_desc_3: The alien looks at me, disappointed. They are an
      official of the Mercenaries Guild, and I think they expected me to salute.
    npc_wguild_greet_med_desc_1: The alien, wearing the uniform of a Mercenaries Guild
      envoy, looks me up and down. I appear to pass muster.
    npc_wguild_greet_med_desc_2: The lifeform, a gruff look upon their face, welcomes
      me to the system on behalf of the Mercenaries Guild.
    npc_wguild_greet_med_desc_3: The lifeform makes a gesture of respect, an acknowledgement
      from one Mercenaries Guild operative to another.
    npc_wguild_greet_high_desc_1: The lifeform wears the insignia of the Mercenaries
      Guild, and stands to attention as I approach.
    npc_wguild_greet_high_desc_2: The alien, scarred from battle, salutes me as I
      approach. They are the Mercenaries Guild commander in this system.
    npc_wguild_greet_high_desc_3: The lifeform, with their neatly pressed uniform
      and alert, precise mannerisms, welcomes me to the system on behalf of the local
      Mercenaries Guild.
    npc_wguild_greet_best_desc_1: The lifeform snaps to attention as soon as they
      see me. Their Mercenaries Guild badge has been polished so vigourously that
      I can see my reflection in it.
    npc_wguild_greet_best_desc_2: The lifeform makes a great show of their salute.
      As the official Mercenaries Guild envoy in this system, it is their duty to
      receive high-ranking members in a fitting style.
    npc_wguild_greet_best_desc_3: The alien wears the badge of a Mercenaries Guild
      commander. They give me a particularly energetic salute.
    dnt_exp_guild_mission_offer_1: The guild requests assistance with this mission.
    dnt_tra_guild_mission_offer_1: The guild requests assistance with this mission.
    dnt_war_guild_mission_offer_1: The guild requests assistance with this mission.
    dnt_exp_guild_tithe_offer_1: 'Valuable guild entity: please accept this this percent
      of earning.'
    dnt_tra_guild_tithe_offer_1: This share of profits is for you, friend.
    dnt_war_guild_tithe_offer_1: This bounty is from the guild, interloper. Well-earned!
    dnt_exp_guild_present_offer_1: 'Valuable guild entity: please accept this gift.'
    dnt_tra_guild_present_offer_1: This gift is for you, friend.
    dnt_war_guild_present_offer_1: A gift from the guild, interloper.
    npc_guild_mission_offer_desc_1: They appear to have some special Guild business
      that needs attending to, and request my assistance.
    npc_guild_mission_offer_desc_2: They hesitate, clearing hoping I will assist them
      with some official Guild business.
    npc_guild_mission_offer_desc_3: They transmit specific data, a mission that they
      cannot entrust to the listings agent. They hope I will be of assistance.
    npc_guild_mission_offer_desc_4: They appear to have a problem client, one with
      a task they feel they can only entrust to a Guild member in good standing.
    npc_guild_mission_offer_desc_5: They offer me the chance to take on a particularly
      lucrative mission, a task for a favoured client.
    npc_guild_tithe_offer_desc_1: They have no particular business for me today, but
      are pleased to be able to present me my share of local operating profits.
    npc_guild_tithe_offer_desc_2: The Guild here has no special tasks at the moment,
      but they have had a recent windfall. They are sharing the loot with all Guild
      members.
    npc_guild_tithe_offer_desc_3: They present me with my share of recent Guild profits,
      accounting for my rank.
    npc_guild_tithe_offer_desc_4: Their greeting over, the envoy turns to business.
      They tally up what I am due from the Guild, my share of recent profits minus
      membership fees owed.
    npc_guild_tithe_offer_desc_5: They present me with an itemised list, a transaction
      record for the Guild's local operations. They offer me a sum of money, my share
      of the profits.
    npc_guild_present_offer_desc_1: They offer me a present, a product of the local
      system that they hope will assist me in my work.
    npc_guild_present_offer_desc_2: They have no specific work for me at the moment.
      They seem apologetic, and offer me a small gift as recompense.
    npc_guild_present_offer_desc_3: The Guild here has matters in hand, and has no
      need of any special operations. However, the envoy does have a gift for me,
      to mark the occasion.
    npc_guild_present_offer_desc_4: The Guild here is flourishing, and all members
      are being offered gifts as thanks for their work. The envoy presents me with
      an item they claim to have picked out for me specially.
    npc_guild_present_offer_desc_5: They make a great show of presenting me with a
      gift, an item acquired by a Guild operative on a recent mission.
    npc_guild_accept_mission: Accept Mission
    npc_guild_accept_gift: Accept Gift
    npc_guild_accept_gift_res_1: I accept the envoy's gift, and make a gesture of
      thanks.
    npc_guild_accept_gift_res_2: I take the present, thanking the Guild and its official.
    npc_guild_accept_gift_res_3: I take the gift, and promise to commend the envoy's
      work to their superiors.
    npc_guild_decline_mission: Decline Mission
    npc_guild_decline_mission_res_1: I turn down their mission. I have other things
      that need doing.
    npc_guild_decline_mission_res_2: I decline their task. The client will have to
      wait.
    npc_guild_decline_mission_res_3: I decline to help the envoy with their task.
      I hope they will not be offended.
    npc_guild_decline_gift: Decline Gift
    npc_guild_decline_gift_res_1: I turn down their offer. I am a member of the Guild,
      but it does not define me. I take nothing, I owe nothing.
    npc_guild_decline_gift_res_2: I decline their offer. I do not need the Guild's
      assistance.
    npc_guild_decline_gift_res_3: I reject the envoy's present. They seem offended.
    npc_guild_secondary_desc_1: The envoy looks busy. I should leave them be.
    npc_guild_secondary_desc_2: I should leave %NAME% be. They have important Guild
      business to attend to, no doubt.
    npc_guild_secondary_desc_3: The Guild envoy in this system has nothing more to
      offer me.
    npc_guild_secondary_desc_4: "%NAME% has plenty of Guild business to work on without
      repeating information for me."
    npc_guild_secondary_desc_5: I have caused enough excitement for %NAME% already.
      I should let them get on with their other Guild work.
    intrct_guild_envoy: Guild Envoy
    dnt_exp_trader_demand_sorry_lan: Eheu! Ship is new, pristine! Repairs will be
      most costly. Transfer units immediately!
    dnt_tra_trader_demand_sorry_lan: What is the meaning of this?! I only wish to
      trade in peace. Do not anger me, friend!
    dnt_war_trader_demand_sorry_lan: The last fool to damage my ship did not live
      to regret their assault! Test me and face death! Grah!
    all_trader_demand_sorry_desc_1: The trader gestures angrily, furious at having
      been assaulted. They demand I make amends.
    all_trader_demand_sorry_desc_2: Waving aggressively, the trader demands an apology.
      They appear to be threatening me with some sort of retribution.
    all_trader_demand_sorry_desc_3: The trader's gestures suggest they are offering
      me a chance to apologise for my actions. I am not sure how they will take it
      if I do not.
    all_trader_demand_sorry_desc_4: The pilot gesticulates wildly, outraged that they
      have been fired upon. This is my chance to apologise, should I wish to.
    all_trader_demand_sorry_desc_5: I am unfamiliar with the full range of alien gestures,
      but none of these seem very happy.
    all_trader_demand_sorry_desc_6: The pilot is unimpressed with my actions, though
      they seem to be offering me a chance to apologise. There is a threat lurking
      behind their words, I feel.
    all_trader_demand_sorry_opt_a: Apologise
    all_trader_demand_sorry_opt_b: Continue to attack
    all_trader_demand_sorry_res_a_1: My apology, and my units, appear to have calmed
      the trader.
    all_trader_demand_sorry_res_a_2: The trader seems satisfied by my apology. They
      will not take this matter further.
    all_trader_demand_sorry_res_a_3: The pilot has calmed considerably. They appear
      to have forgiven me.
    dnt_exp_trader_submit_lang_1: Convergence wishes peace. Cease your assault.
    dnt_exp_trader_submit_lang_2: Korvax will comply. Entity will state demands.
    dnt_exp_trader_submit_lang_3: Eheu! Shell entity fears damage! Please, make peace!
    dnt_tra_trader_submit_lang_1: Friend! This is not friendly behaviour. Trade peace
      for units?
    dnt_tra_trader_submit_lang_2: Trade ship is new, cargo is valuable. Perhaps a
      deal, friend?
    dnt_tra_trader_submit_lang_3: Friend! Such a sad day. Calm your anger with the
      joy of trade!
    dnt_war_trader_submit_lang_1: Grah! Interloper! I do not have time for such foolishness!
      Take this and begone!
    dnt_war_trader_submit_lang_2: Grah! You seek glory in this pointless conflict?
      Take these units and seek your fights elsewhere.
    dnt_war_trader_submit_lang_3: Grah! Vy'keen will comply with the Traveller's wishes.
      You want my cargo?
    all_trader_submit_desc_1: Begging for their life, the trader frantically gestures
      for me to cease my assault.
    all_trader_submit_desc_2: The trader babbles, panic-stricken, begging me to stop.
      They appear to be offering me some sort of tribute.
    all_trader_submit_desc_3: It is hard to make sense of their message, but the panicked
      trader appears to be trying to negotiate.
    all_trader_submit_desc_4: The pilot pleads with me, seemingly offering their cargo
      in exchange for their life.
    all_trader_submit_desc_5: Wide-eyed and breathing heavily, the trader seems relieved
      to have made contact. They seem to be believe I might be persuaded to show mercy...
    all_trader_submit_opt_a: Accept offer
    all_trader_submit_opt_b: Decline
    all_trader_submit_res_a_1: I accept the trader's offer. They live... for now.
    all_trader_submit_res_a_2: Relief floods the pilot's face. They thank me for my
      grace.
    all_trader_submit_res_a_3: I accept the pilot's tribute. They thank me for letting
      them live, but I see the resentment burning in their eyes.
    all_trader_submit_res_a_4: The trader transmits their payment, good to their word.
      I should leave them be, if I am to be true to mine...
    all_trader_submit_res_a_5: The pilot transfers their cargo as quickly as possible,
      keen to get as far away from me as possible.
    all_trader_submit_res_b_1: I refuse their cowardly offer. Death or glory awaits!
    all_trader_submit_res_b_2: I ignore the begs and cries of the pilot. I have no
      need of their cargo.
    all_trader_submit_res_b_3: I have no need of this trader's random assortment of
      cargo. Their ship is worth far more as scrap...
    all_trader_submit_res_c_1: Defiance flashes across the pilot's face. They break
      off communications, having used this time to call for help.
    all_trader_submit_res_c_2: The terror in the trader's eyes turns to anger. I see
      their ships weapons coming online. They never intended to pay me...
    all_trader_submit_res_c_3: The trader breaks off the call without making the transfer.
      They seem to have found some new source of courage...
    dnt_exp_trader_hostile_lang_1: I'm a Korvax! Since you're here, let's fight!
    dnt_exp_trader_hostile_lang_2: I'm a Korvax! Since you're here, let's fight!
    dnt_exp_trader_hostile_lang_3: I'm a Korvax! Since you're here, let's fight!
    dnt_tra_trader_hostile_lang_1: I'm a Gek! Since you're here, let's fight!
    dnt_tra_trader_hostile_lang_2: I'm a Gek! Since you're here, let's fight!
    dnt_tra_trader_hostile_lang_3: I'm a Gek! Since you're here, let's fight!
    dnt_war_trader_hostile_lang_1: I'm a Vy'keen! Since you're here, let's fight!
    dnt_war_trader_hostile_lang_2: I'm a Vy'keen! Since you're here, let's fight!
    dnt_war_trader_hostile_lang_3: I'm a Vy'keen! Since you're here, let's fight!
    all_trader_hostile_desc_1: The threatening look in the pilot's eyes tells me all
      I need to know. They are not interested in trading...
    all_trader_hostile_desc_2: My contact appears to have alerted the pilot to the
      value of ship and its cargo. There is a dangerous glint in their eyes.
    all_trader_hostile_desc_3: The pilot's angry gestures suggest they are in no mood
      for peaceful trading. I seem to have a fight on my hands.
    all_trader_hostile_desc_4: The 'trader' I have disturbed appears in no mood for
      trading. As they speak, I see them begin to arm their weapons.
    all_trader_hostile_desc_5: Though they fly a trader's flag, this pilot is clearly
      no humble merchant. Even over the communicator's static, I can sense their pirate
      swagger.
    all_trader_hostile_opt_a: Begin combat
    all_trader_hostile_opt_b: Offer tribute
    all_trader_hostile_res_a_1: A real pirate would have attacked on sight. This trader
      is nothing but a cowardly opportunist.
    all_trader_hostile_res_a_2: This 'pirate' offered a lot of angry sounding words.
      Let's see what else they have to offer...
    all_trader_hostile_res_a_3: I will not be bullied by some scheming trader. If
      they want a fight, they shall have one.
    all_trader_hostile_res_b_1: The 'trader' accepts my offer. I write it off as the
      cost of doing business in dangerous space.
    all_trader_hostile_res_b_2: My offer seems to have calmed the trader. We leave
      each other in peace, at least for now.
    all_trader_hostile_res_b_3: The 'trader' made their meaning clear. I hand over
      a payment, and they fly away happy.
    dnt_exp_trader_ambush_lang_1: Pretends to have been attacked
    dnt_exp_trader_ambush_lang_2: Wants you to transfer fuel
    dnt_exp_trader_ambush_lang_3: Pretends to have been attacked
    dnt_exp_trader_ambush_lang_4: Wants you to transfer fuel
    dnt_exp_trader_ambush_lang_5: Pretends to have been attacked
    dnt_exp_trader_ambush_lang_6: Wants you to transfer fuel
    dnt_tra_trader_ambush_lang_1: Pretends to have been attacked
    dnt_tra_trader_ambush_lang_2: Wants you to transfer fuel
    dnt_tra_trader_ambush_lang_3: Pretends to have been attacked
    dnt_tra_trader_ambush_lang_4: Wants you to transfer fuel
    dnt_tra_trader_ambush_lang_5: Pretends to have been attacked
    dnt_tra_trader_ambush_lang_6: Wants you to transfer fuel
    dnt_war_trader_ambush_lang_1: Pretends to have been attacked
    dnt_war_trader_ambush_lang_2: Wants you to transfer fuel
    dnt_war_trader_ambush_lang_3: Pretends to have been attacked
    dnt_war_trader_ambush_lang_4: Wants you to transfer fuel
    dnt_war_trader_ambush_lang_5: Pretends to have been attacked
    dnt_war_trader_ambush_lang_6: Ambush stuff!
    all_trader_ambush_desc_1: It is hard to make out their exact meaning, but the
      trader appears to be asking for help. They seem tense.
    all_trader_ambush_desc_2: The trader is clearly on edge. They appear to need help,
      and gesture for me to move my ship closer.
    all_trader_ambush_desc_3: The trader looks tired. They speak hurriedly, apparently
      outlining some problem or another. They seem to need my help.
    all_trader_ambush_desc_4: Nervous, the pilot delivers some pre-prepared speech.
      It seems like some sort of plea for help. They gesture as they finish, waiting
      for a response.
    all_trader_ambush_desc_5: The trader is demanding help, that much is clear. It
      is hard to make out the exact problem, but it seems of utmost importance that
      I move in close to their ship...
    all_trader_ambush_desc_6: The trader seems to be asking for help, their ship apparently
      damaged in some crucial way. But their eyes are hard and mean, showing no relief
      at their rescue.
    all_trader_ambush_desc_7: The trader speaks quickly, babbling. Again and again
      they repeat what seems to be a request for help, their manner demanding and
      insistent.
    all_trader_ambush_desc_8: The trader, almost weeping, spins me a story of woe.
      They beg for my help, insisting that all I need do is fly close while they prepare
      their ship.
    all_trader_ambush_opt_a: Attempt to help
    all_trader_ambush_opt_b: Refuse help
    all_trader_ambush_res_a_1: I keep my ship flying in formation with the trader,
      but something is wrong. Hostile signatures flood the subspace radar...
    all_trader_ambush_res_a_2: I move in close, as requested, but the radio falls
      silent. As I try to hail the trader, I notice their weapon systems coming online...
    all_trader_ambush_res_a_3: I attempt to comply with the trader's request, but
      they remain evasive. My pulse engine begins to stutter, and my radar displays
      a collection of unknown signals approaching fast...
    all_trader_ambush_res_b_1: The trader's manner is highly suspicious. I leave them
      be, and prepare to warp away before any trouble begins.
    all_trader_ambush_res_b_2: This situation is highly suspicious. Despite their
      pleas, I prepare to leave this trader where they float.
    all_trader_ambush_res_b_3: I leave the trader where they are. They curse me as
      I end the communication, but I fear things would be far worse should I get any
      closer.
    dnt_exp_trader_defend_lang_1: I'm a Korvax! Help me with these pirates!!
    dnt_exp_trader_defend_lang_2: I'm a Korvax! Help me with these pirates!!
    dnt_exp_trader_defend_lang_3: I'm a Korvax! Help me with these pirates!!
    dnt_tra_trader_defend_lang_1: I'm a Gek! Help me with these pirates!!
    dnt_tra_trader_defend_lang_2: I'm a Gek! Help me with these pirates!!
    dnt_tra_trader_defend_lang_3: I'm a Gek! Help me with these pirates!!
    dnt_war_trader_defend_lang_1: I'm a Vy'keen! Help me with these pirates!!
    dnt_war_trader_defend_lang_2: I'm a Vy'keen! Help me with these pirates!!
    dnt_war_trader_defend_lang_3: I'm a Vy'keen! Help me with these pirates!!
    all_trader_defend_desc_1: The pilot gestures frantically. Their ship seems damaged,
      and there are hostile signals approaching on the subspace radar...
    all_trader_defend_desc_2: The pilot's words are hard to understand, but the data
      they've transmitted is not. A large number of pirate vessels are approaching,
      and fast.
    all_trader_defend_desc_3: With pleading eyes, the trader transmit their navigational
      data. They have been hounded by pirates, and now fear they have been cornered.
      The fight is nearly upon us.
    all_trader_defend_desc_4: The trader's ship is crippled, its engines scarred by
      a previous narrow escape. They beg for help, unable to continue fleeing the
      violence that stalks them.
    all_trader_defend_desc_5: The trader's ship is heavy with goods but light on weapons.
      They ask me to escort them, promising to make it worth my while...
    all_trader_defend_opt_a: Help the trader
    all_trader_defend_opt_b: Leave them to their fate
    all_trader_defend_res_a_1: I indicate to the trader that I will help. Just in
      time, it seems, as the pirates are nearly on top of us...
    all_trader_defend_res_a_2: I will help the pilot make their stand. No-one deserves
      to be hounded by pirates.
    all_trader_defend_res_a_3: The pirates will not be expecting a second ship. We
      will turn this ambush on its head.
    all_trader_defend_res_b_1: It is unfortunate, but this trader's fight is not my
      fight. I leave them to their fate.
    all_trader_defend_res_b_2: Whatever this trader has done, it has upset some dangerous
      people. I should leave before I upset them too.
    all_trader_defend_res_b_3: I do not want to get mixed up in whatever business
      has gone on here. I should leave, and quickly.
    dnt_exp_trader_thank_lang_1: Thanks for your help with the pirates! Have some
      stuff!
    dnt_exp_trader_thank_lang_2: Thanks for your help with the pirates! Have some
      stuff!
    dnt_exp_trader_thank_lang_3: Thanks for your help with the pirates! Have some
      stuff!
    dnt_tra_trader_thank_lang_1: Thanks for your help with the pirates! Have some
      stuff!
    dnt_tra_trader_thank_lang_2: Thanks for your help with the pirates! Have some
      stuff!
    dnt_tra_trader_thank_lang_3: Thanks for your help with the pirates! Have some
      stuff!
    dnt_war_trader_thank_lang_1: Thanks for your help with the pirates! Have some
      stuff!
    dnt_war_trader_thank_lang_2: Thanks for your help with the pirates! Have some
      stuff!
    dnt_war_trader_thank_lang_3: Thanks for your help with the pirates! Have some
      stuff!
    all_trader_thank_desc_1: The trader thanks me for my help, and offers me a share
      of their cargo.
    all_trader_thank_desc_2: The relief on the pilot's face is obvious to see. They
      offer me a share of their cargo as thanks for my help.
    all_trader_thank_desc_3: The pilot can finally relax, free from their pursuers.
      They present me with a gift, a token of thanks for my effort.
    all_trader_thank_desc_4: Safe at last, the pilot thanks me for my help. They offer
      my a gift from their cargo hold.
    all_trader_thank_desc_5: Though their words are unfamiliar, the pilot's face tells
      their story. Relieved to be rid of the pirates, they prepare to transmit some
      of their cargo.
    all_trader_thank_opt_a: Accept the gift
    all_trader_thank_opt_b: Decline their gift
    all_trader_thank_res_a_1: The trader transmits the cargo, happy. It is a small
      price to pay compared to what they might have lost.
    all_trader_thank_res_a_2: Grateful, the pilot transmits their cargo. I wish them
      luck in finding safe habour.
    all_trader_thank_res_a_3: The trader transmit the cargo and hurries away, relieved
      that this whole episode is over.
    all_trader_thank_res_b_1: I decline the trader's offer. Destroying pirates is
      its own reward.
    all_trader_thank_res_b_2: I refuse the gift, and wish them luck avoiding pirates
      in the future.
    all_trader_thank_res_b_3: I tell the trader to keep their cargo. They'll need
      all they can to pay for the repair of their ship.
