      expecting to meet someone else?

      No Man's Sky Expeditions brings a vast array of new features. For full details please see www.nomanssky.com.

      * Introducing a new game mode: Community Expeditions.
      * Start afresh with a brand new journey across the universe, with bespoke challenges and milestones.
      * New expeditions will start regularly, and each will bring exclusive rewards.
      * Each expedition will have its own theme and sets of challenges.
      * Expedition Mode saves will be available when the expedition ends, but no more rewards will be earned.

      Hello Games has been hard at work to improve and expand No Man's Sky. We hope you enjoy. :)

      The Ancients speak of the Gek. Of their change. Of their crimes. But dishonour is unchanging. Crimes marked in blood do not fade. We do not forget. But we accept.

      'We accept'. What does acceptance mean, cubs? How can evil be suffered to live? Why does our fleet not go to war? Why do we not destroy the enemies of Hirk wherever they exist, whatever they call themselves, whatever the cost?

      All of this has happened before, the Ancients teach us. There are many iterations... many dreams. In all of them, we failed, or lost ourselves in victory.

      There will come a day soon when the truth of the Gek will be revealed. We do not need to fight. They will destroy themselves...

      through two means. The brotherhood of the entire species in the light of Hirk.
      We are all family. This must be taught.\n\nWe were once prey. Now, we are predators.
      All other life in this universe shall fear us, just as we feared them. Fear
      will be our strength.\n\nThat ancient cry - 'Grah!' - our rallying call, our

    exp_abandshop_desc1: The Korvax scans me as I approach, wary of my intentions.
      They check their data and relax, satisfied I am not a threat.
    exp_abandshop_desc2: A series of lights flash across the lifeform's visor. A tingle
      runs across my scalp. It feels unpleasant, as if my thoughts have been rummaged
      through.
    exp_abandshop_desc3: The Korvax blanks the screen of their personal datapad as
      I approach. They seem to be attempting to look innocent, if these electronic
      lifeforms are capable of such a thing.
    exp_abandshop_desc_short: The Korvax awaits my decision.
    tra_abandshop_desc1: I sense the now-familiar trading pheromone as I approach
      the Gek, but there is something else mixed in. I feel an overwhelming sense
      of grey, a murky fog at winding itself through my mind.
    tra_abandshop_desc2: The Gek smiles shyly as I approach. An act, for I see the
      outline of a weapon amidst the chaos of their stall.
    tra_abandshop_desc3: The Gek beams as I approach their ramshackle trading post.
      They brush aside a strange collection of wires and give me their full attention.
    tra_abandshop_desc_short: The Gek awaits my decision.
    war_abandshop_desc1: The Vy'keen stiffens as I approach, though they do their
      best to hide it. They are nervous, on their guard.
    war_abandshop_desc2: The Vy'keen sizes me up as I approach. I appear to pass muster,
      for they do not dismiss me from their presence.
    war_abandshop_desc3: These ramshackle surroundings do not suit the Vy'keen I find
      here. They glare at me as I approach.
    war_abandshop_desc_short: The Vy'keen awaits my decision.
    exp_abandshop_lang1: Enterprising entity. You seek knowledge, opportunity?
    exp_abandshop_lang2: Traveller-Entity, welcome. Korvax knows much. Traveller also
      seeks hidden knowledge, we think.
    exp_abandshop_lang3: You have business here, Traveller-Entity? You seek lost records,
      hidden data?
    tra_abandshop_lang1: Opportunity, profit for all, yes? No restrictions on what
      can be sold, I think?
    tra_abandshop_lang2: I offer many services, friend! Some lifeforms are uneasy
      with this business, but all profit is profit, yes?
    tra_abandshop_lang3: Do you feel brave, Traveller-Friend? Good! Be bold! Seek
      profit! We will prosper together, I think!
    war_abandshop_lang1: Grah! Another inspection? Is Vy'keen honour not enough?
    war_abandshop_lang2: Grah! There is no honour for the shopkeeper. But there is
      glory in the hunt, interloper! You agree, I think?

    tra_abandshop_res_a1: Discreetly, the Gek places a small radio device down in
      front of them. I pick it up. They stare at me, nod, then turn away.
    tra_abandshop_res_a2: Gently, I pick up the small radio device the Gek has carefully
      lain in front of me. We nod at each other.
    tra_abandshop_res_a3: With a faint nod of their head, the Gek clears the air.
      Their pheromones fade. I look down into my hands and see a small radio device.
    exp_abandshop_res_a1: With a roll of their fingers, the electronic lifeform deposits
      a small radio receiver in my hand. They dim their visor as I examine it.
    exp_abandshop_res_a2: I hear a faint, rapidly-modulated whistle. Then, with the
      faintest nod of the head, the Korvax hands me a small radio device.
    exp_abandshop_res_a3: With a movement so swift and delicate, the Korvax places
      a small radio device in my hands. Were it not for the package I now hold, I
      would scarcely believe they had moved at all.
    war_abandshop_res_a1: The Vy'keen thrusts a radio receiver into my hands. They
      grunt, then turn away.
    war_abandshop_res_a2: The Vy'keen places a radio receiver in front of them. I
      pick it up. They say nothing.
    war_abandshop_res_a3: Wordlessly, the Vy'keen hands me a small radio device. Even
      as I take it, they turn away. The transaction is over.
    npc_abandshop_opt_b: Ask what they are selling
    tra_abandshop_res_b: Large ships suffer strange fates, friend! But their cargo
      is very valuable! Lots of profit to be had, for the brave...
    exp_abandshop_res_b: Traveller-Entity seeks new places to explore. Such places
      exist. They float from system to system, abandoned wrecks. They can be revealed,
      for a price.

    ui_aband_crewnote_1: Has been prone to unstable mood swings. Hyperspace sickness,
      or something else?
    ui_aband_crewnote_2: AI Sympathiser - have them followed.
    ui_aband_crewnote_3: |-
      Collects strange objects. Why?
      ADDENDUM (<TECHNOLOGY><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<>): The collection has become a problem. Use of company cargo storage for personal objects is strictly against protocol. Intervention required.
    ui_aband_crewnote_4: Roams at midnight - have the watch officer check the cameras.
    ui_aband_crewnote_5: Increasingly fraternises outside of their specialisation.
      Unusual behaviour for their class.
    ui_aband_crewnote_6: The crew believes them cursed. Morale is suffering.
    ui_aband_crewnote_7: Borrows heavily from mess mates. Danger brewing.
    ui_aband_crewnote_8: Large personal food supply - where from?
    ui_aband_crewnote_9: Acquired a range of exotic creatures at local market during
      stoppage. Will turn blind eye, for now.
    ui_aband_crewnote_10: Overly curious about mission destination. What do they suspect?
    ui_aband_crewnote_11: Studies the charts at night - thinks I don't notice.
    ui_aband_crewnote_12: Using ship's radio for personal broadcast. Signals are harmless,
      have allowed to continue.
    ui_aband_crewnote_13: In a relationship with a passenger. Have them removed at
      next station.
    ui_aband_crewnote_14: Security does not trust them. As yet, no evidence.
    ui_aband_crewnote_15: Using ship's resources for personal 'experiments'. Must
      consult with other officers.
    ui_aband_crewnote_16: Occasional bouts of dread - intervention required. Follow
      up with medics.
    ui_aband_crewnote_17: Currently reading many strange pamphlets. Must find out
      where they get them.
    ui_aband_crewnote_18: Preaching odd messages to the rest of the crew. Must intervene,
      but without upsetting those converted...
    ui_aband_crewnote_19: Highly sensitive - reacts badly to any censure. Has begun
      muttering to themselves.
    ui_aband_crewnote_20: They have become highly disaffected with the mission - or
      perhaps the entire company? Unsure how to solve.
    ui_aband_crewnote_21: Has become increasingly difficult to work with. They blame
      inability to rest. Something else is wrong.
    ui_aband_crewnote_22: Keeps getting into fights with other crew members. Requires
      stronger discipline than mere confinement.
    ui_aband_crewnote_23: Frequent visits to the medical bay. Potential disease vector?
      Infecting other crew?
    ui_aband_crewnote_24: Has suffered from frequent blackouts since we used the black
      hole. Tests come back negative. Worrying.
    ui_aband_crewnote_25: Repeatedly insubordinate. Something in them has changed
      since we departed. Discipline is breaking down across the ship.
    ui_aband_crewnote_26: |-
      Has retreated to their cabin. At first, skipping social events, then eating alone, and now they have deserted their duties.
      ADDENDUM (<TECHNOLOGY><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<>): Their door is barricaded. There is no noise from within.
    ui_aband_crewnote_27: Made a number of personal trades at the last space station.
      Is using their money to influence their mess mates. To what end?
    ui_aband_crewnote_28: |-
      Has become more and more anxious as the voyage has gone on. They are increasingly concerned with the safety valves fitted to the ship's AI core.
      ADDENDUM (<TECHNOLOGY><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<>): Engineering reassure me that the values are perfectly fine. I cannot abide this constant nervousness. I have banned them from the bridge.
    ui_aband_crewnote_29: |-
      Highly dedicated to the mission. Their enthusiasm is to be commended.
      ...
      ADDENDUM (<TECHNOLOGY><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<>): I am increasingly overwhelmed by their behaviour. Such zealotry is difficult to deal with.
    ui_aband_crewnote_30: |-
      Highly disliked by their messmates. Rumours are spreading. Discipline must be enforced.
      ADDENDUM (<TECHNOLOGY><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<>): Have placed them in isolation for their own protection.

      <SPECIAL>Derelict Freighters<> are dangerous environments, full of environmental hazards and hostile entities. They contain a lot of <STELLAR>valuable salvage<>, as well as <SPECIAL>special items<> that can be exchanged aboard a Space Station for nanites or standing.

      To find a derelict freighter, purchase an <TECHNOLOGY>Emergency Signal Scanner<> from the Space Station <SPECIAL>Scrap Dealer<>. Use the receiver from your inventory to locate a derelict.

      As well as valuable loot and significant quantities of nanites, it is possible to use the engineering systems of a derelict freighter to generate valuable <TECHNOLOGY>Freighter Technology<>, including upgrades to <STELLAR>fleet systems<> and tools to <STELLAR>expand your freighter's inventory<>.

      Travellers may share the location of particularly interesting wrecks, as each star system has one specific wreck. It may be salvaged more than once, but to see new derelicts, you must travel to new systems.

      Travellers interested in acquiring a <STELLAR>free<> Emergency Signal Scanner should speak to <TRADEABLE>Iteration Helios<> aboard the Space Anomaly.

      This craft is like none I have ever seen before. It looks... alive.
      Its broadcast is pure music, and yet I understand, the melody making words in my mind.
      The <SPECIAL>Void Egg<> I acquired from the Space Anomaly begins to resonate in response...
    ui_hail_alienship_lang1: We hear you, Traveller. We are connected. Your body is
      of ours.
    ui_hail_alienship_opt1: Continue to listen
    ui_hail_alienship_res1: The tones that had previously formed words now shift in

    ui_hail_alienship_desc3: The words of the ship ring in my ears. They have real
      expression, an un-synthesisable quality. And yet, I see no pilot.
    ui_hail_alienship_lang3: You are on our path. We see it. We understand where it
      leads. It is necessary. Perhaps we thank you. Perhaps.
    ui_hail_alienship_opt3: Accept transmission

      Each time this being floods my ship with their beautiful song, I attempt to commit the experience to memory, to recall it later.
      And yet, when it fades from my present, it fades entirely. All I have is navigation data...
    ui_hail_alienship_desc5: The song of this strange space creature has changed,
      subtle but unmistakable. It has become a duet, a perfect harmony with the <SPECIAL>Void
      Egg<> .
    ui_hail_alienship_lang5: It is nearly complete. But here we will diverge. If you
      share yourself with us, it is sacrifice. There is no infinite mind to spill.
      It must be yielded.
